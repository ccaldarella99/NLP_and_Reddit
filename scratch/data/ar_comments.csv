It was 3 years ago. I was 29 at the time so it was a tough decision to choose between something at least seemingly “secure” vs what is essentially an unknown path.

I spent a lot of my free time during my last 2 years of school researching alternative career paths within healthcare before even considering something outside and analyzing what I like and disliked about my current situation. 

Only you know what you want. So being able to put those preferences into concrete thoughts as opposed to just feeling the dislike for the current situation helped me find the right path.

Some time later, when I had my anxiety more under control, she asked me if it helped my pain and I told her that my pain was exactly the same, maybe a little worse.

I explained that I was still getting a lot of medical tests done and she decided I was in denial about how anxious I actually was.

I fpubd out that my gallbladder is non functioning and rather inflamed. It took a long time to find it because I got normal ultrasounds and typically a low functioning gallbladder has gallstones.

A listener asks G'Kar, ""What is truth, and what is God""

G'Kar replies:
""If I take a lamp, and shine it towards the wall, a bright spot will appear on the wall. The lamp is our search for truth, for understanding. Too often we assume that the light on the wall is God. But the light is not the goal of the search. It is the result of the search.

""The more intense the search, the brighter the light on the wall. The brighter the light on the wall, the greater the sense of revalation upon seeing it. Similarly, someone who does not search, who does not bring a lantern with him, sees nothing.

""What we perceive as God, is mearly the by-product of our search for God. It may simply be an appreciation of the light, put and unblemished, not understanding that it comes from us. Sometimes we stand in front of the light and assume we are the centre of the universe - God looks asstonishingly like we do. Or we turn to look at our shadow - and assume that all is darkness.

""If we allow ourselves to get in the way, we defeat the purpose. Which is to use the light of our search to illuminate the wall in all it's beauty and in all its flaws, and in so doing better understand the world around us"".

Then there's these quotes:
""If I project a beam of light at the wall, you see the light on the wall, but the wall is not the source of the light. It comes in from somewhere else. The soul is also a projection. It does not exist inside us any more than the light exists inside the wall. But this .. shell is the only way we can perceive it.""    
-- Lennier to Brother Edward in Babylon 5:""Passing Through Gethsemane""

""We believe that the universe itself is conscious in a way we can never truly understand. It is engaged in a search for meaning. So it .. breaks itself apart, investing its own consciousness in every form of life.""

My family spearheaded by my dad has always had this narrative I em a cry baby or I just make shit up or lie for attention or whatever when its totally the complete opposite I just keep everything to myself cause maybe I em wrong or other ppl have their problems to they don't need to be burdened with my problems 

For example as a child over at my aunt's house climbing on her monkey bars I kept falling but I kept getting back up and trying again the 3rd or 4th try I fell chest down landing on my arm on a rock I got up crying and screaming from the pain my mother ignored me told my aunt I was faking and continued the convo. They were having after a few mins of this my aunt stopped her I don't think he is faking took me to a doctor turns out I had a green limb fracture one of the most painful fractures you could have what the doctor at the time told us

Years later teenager then was having issues with my teeth tell dad and his current wife and they would say nothing and just look at each other for a bit and tell me not this month son ask next month I guess they hoped I would just forget? Idk but next month try again same story 3 months after the first time I tried I gave up and one day got up refused to go to school cause the pain was too much to bare dad looks at me and goes son you have to tell me these things or I can't help.......dad wtf are you talking about I have been telling you for 3 months and he just froze like he had this realization oh shit he is right

So I finally get taken to the dentist we go in get our teeth cleaned and I get x-rays of my teeth taken and they say I needed 900$ of work done as we leave dad turns to me and says sorry son we don't have the money 

see they were saving to go on a cruise dad had taken his previous gf on one and kept promising his current wife he would take her on one and that would have cut into that money I never tried after that years later in my 20s then me my brother and dad are talking and I bring up that story he just goes fucking nuts screaming in my face that never happened and I'm a fucking liar later on tells me it's ok son we just remember different things 

Or they constantly remove me from things that happened tell someone a story about the family and they will cut me out of it or fill me in with one of my brothers or he will just replace me in something that happened to me that he wasn't even there for 

Now I em a 30+ still living at home struggle with depression anxiety and the rest of the bs but I don't trust myself if I em even really experiencing these things or if those things are to do to the blow I took to the forehead as a child a blow hard enough I have had a indent on my forehead my entire life something I have read up on recently and learned that could actually explain some of my problems but then I question if that is right maybe my body already repaired the damage from that which no they never took me to the hospital when that happened and dad has told me his version of how that even happened his version is I walked up behind him when he was getting ready to throw his horseshoe I walked up behind him and that apparently had enough force to put an indent in my forehead for the rest of my life

Or the fucking chunk missing out of my left ear no idea wtf happened with that when I ask my mom she just laughs at me like I'm nuts like mom I clearly had a piece of my left ear removed either by something biting me when I was a kid or someone cutting my ear 

And now here I em an ""adult"" who has no self worth or self confidence, everytime I have clawed some of that back for myself something happens that kicks me back down again back into their hands and now I have a fucking book here if me venting and bitching even now stressing on if I should even post this but I need to stop before I keep going but reading this has been a relief to an extent knowing that other ppl have experienced things like this or worse and writing this has been some relief getting some of this out there , off my chest my poor friend is usually the one who gets all this which she encourages me to leave but at this point I don't know if I even can lol",,,1619304676,{},gvrc82h,False,t3_mxf4dl,False,False,t1_gvntsce,/r/AskReddit/comments/mxf4dl/what_is_the_most_toxic_thing_a_parent_can_say_to/gvrc82h/,1619321135,1,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

[],,GinjaNinja90,,,[],,,,text,t2_sqi39,False,False,[],"I’ve been working on the same for around 15 years now. It became easier for me when I realized (thanks to a great therapist) that I can’t control her or the type of people she brings around (no matter what those people have done to her own kids). Once that clicked, I started setting boundaries: what I refused to talk about with her, how I deserve to be treated, all the things I felt shouldn’t take place in my presence, I guess. It didn’t go over well at first! She was the worst during that time-pushing the boundary to see if I was serious I guess. 

Some days, it feels like it works so well then other times it’s like she just doesn’t get it...or care. During those times, I cut off the convo because it throws me into a situational type depression if I don’t. It’s rough like it takes me back to those times I felt so worthless. These times don’t happen that often anymore. It did happen recently, but before that it had been years. The difference this time was that I know she was just trying to pull me down. I’ve done well with my life and she’s living in a motel. She hates that I’m the only one of her kids that “made it.” Once I realized that she just wanted me to feel as badly as she does, I wasn’t as upset with her anymore. She had her own issues. All this to say it’s not an easy fix. But it is worth it.

Your mental health is MOST important. Always protect that. If that means walking out when the gaslighting starts? Do it. If that means hanging up the call, do it. 

I live hours away now, but before I moved I always had an escape plan. I’d drive my own car to events so I could leave if I needed, only stopped in for short visits and used my dog as an excuse to get home, things like that. Now when I visit my family, I stay in a hotel and only see her for a little while. 

It’s really about keeping yourself as comfortable as possible. Because then you’ll be able to enjoy some things without always feeling scared/nervous about what she’s going to throw in your face. Because if you cut that out of the conversations enough times she’ll eventually give up that game. I found that not responding to my mom’s jabs and gaslighting makes her stop quicker. She can’t get angry if you just don’t engage. But make sure you have someone to vent to or some way to release all the anger afterwards. Bc it will still hurt and piss you off-just don’t let her see it.

You do not deserve to be treated that way. Don’t let her make you feel like you do. Remind yourself this every time you need to.

It’s possible to build a new relationship that works. But it won’t be like the mother/child relationships the lucky kids get (at least in my experience). However, it can be one that’s on YOUR terms. And that’s still pretty good, right?

It took years for me and some good therapy. If you haven’t, maybe look into therapy. That’s really what helped me keep my backbone. 

Remind yourself that you’re stronger than she could ever be. You’ve already been through hell, you can do this! And it’s 100% ok to go no contact for a while if you need the break, you’re not a bad child. She’s the problem, not you.

I know I just wrote so much, but it’s a lot to deal with. I’m similar to you where we can talk about day to day things, but if anything close to what happened to me comes up, I have to end the convo or I’ll shut down. My mom will never admit what happened to me bc that would mean admitting she’s wrong. She could never face that. I’m 31 and it’s still so hard to think about when it comes up. Because your mom is supposed to be the one to protect and love you! Not the one who throws you away. I don’t know if she and I will ever get to the point where it can ever be brought up in a healing type of conversation. Doesn’t mean it’s not possible, but she would have to make some changes first and that’s probably not going to happen. 

I do wish you luck and hey if you ever need someone to vent to, feel free to inbox me. I obviously don’t know your situation, but it does help to talk to someone who somewhat gets it.",,,1619304529,{},gvrby2w,False,t3_mxf4dl,False,False,t1_gvr7a5q,/r/AskReddit/comments/mxf4dl/what_is_the_most_toxic_thing_a_parent_can_say_to/gvrby2w/,1619320980,15,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

I don’t know if there’s an alternative but it has always rubbed me the wrong way that voters in New England and the South have the same influence over federal laws under which the voters of the West Coast also have to live, despite these regions being worlds apart in terms of culture, resources, values, and industry. 

Federal overreach has been unstoppable since the start, and I don’t think there’s any way to roll back focus to states’ rights. But honestly, if Alabama wants to teach creationism in their schools, fine. We’d cut off federal funding, but they can teach anything they want under private funds. If Florida wants to ban transgender athletes from competing alongside their aligned gender groups, go for it. Just don’t tell Oregon or Washington that they have to follow suit. There’s plenty of room in California for LGBT+ citizens (especially if we kick all the rednecks out of &gt;!you know which towns I mean.!&lt;) 

But seriously, we don’t all have to agree on literally everything to peacefully co-habit this pretty much underused space.

She used to live at one of the houses which was in a normal looking suburban neighborhood. The clinic was right next door. If you drove down the street they just looked like normal houses. But the neighbors were not to fond of the facility being there.

Anyway. She used to work the night shift every night. From 10 to 7. So I decided to get up early that morning drive over to where she lived and surprise her with some flowers. So I got there early and parked in front of a house next to the one she lived in. I waited about ten minutes and I see her leave the house she worked in and begin to make her way home. 
I get out of the car. Put the flowers behind my back. I shut the door. She sees me. I smile. She smiles delighted. I see two cop cars coming down the street at high speeds. I say oh shit. The cop cars pull up to me and two officers get out asking what I was doing there.

Something being natural doesn't mean that it is correct, morally speaking. There is absolutely no correlation between the two. Our reproductive organs exist so that we can procreate and generate healthy offspring. But I suppose you aren't against homosexual relationships, or the usage of condoms, or marriages involving at least one infertile person, just because said scenarios defy the way in which our bodies were designed, right? 

I really don't understand your comment about breast milk. Obviously, I am not against it. My opposition towards the consumption of animal based products stems from its negative consequences, all of which are non-existent when it comes to this practice. 

I also do not condemn the attitudes taken by early humans in order to survive and develop themselves. Just like any other wild animal, they had no choice, and eating meat was a requirement. But again, we are not in the Paleolithic. Currently, millions of people could switch to a plant-based diet, yourself included, probably. Not doing so is an irrational choice. 

Now, you also seem to believe that vegan diets are unhealthy. But [according to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19562864/), which is the [largest of its kind in the US](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Nutrition_and_Dietetics), ""appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.""

So it seems that the unnatural option is not only fine, but it may actually be overall healthier than an animal-based diet.

There is no argument against veganism, or at the very least vegetarianism, when it comes to people who are capable of switching to said diets. If you are fine with the grotesque price of consuming meat just because it tastes good, you are no better than someone who watches child pornography, supporting the suffering of innocent beings for your own pleasure.",,,1619304464,{},gvrbttp,False,t3_mxlkmo,False,True,t1_gvqaxu5,/r/AskReddit/comments/mxlkmo/whats_something_thats_always_on_your_mind_but_you/gvrbttp/,1619320915,1,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

Well, I once was engaged to a hot latino type chick I met at College. We hit it off so good, did a ton of partying and the sex was amazing!

After dating her a while, I could tell there was something strange about her family. She claimed that she didn’t know what part of the world her ancestors were from, didn’t know where her last name came from, her parents had blonde hair and blue eyes, but had Latino accents. I later found out their first language was Portuguese and they were from Brazil.

Anyway, about a year later I asked her father for her hand in marriage, he sat down with me and explained that his parents were avid Nazis who fled to Brazil just before the war ended. 

He obviously didn’t like for people to know this, and had a hard time finding a way to tell me. I didn’t really care. I told him that I loved her for who she was and it didn’t matter who her grandparents were, all that mattered was who she was.

Anyway, it seemed important for her that I meet her relatives in Brazil, and apparently, her parents went there to visit every few years. So we planned the most bizarre trip of my life. When you first arrive, nothing seems off about the colony. They speak Portuguese and German, they have jobs, they drive cars, they don’t stand out in any way except that they look different than other Brazilians. The colony is isolated, and the few locals who are around don’t seem to care of really quite grasp what’s going on. But once you start talking to people, you realize that they are deeply disturbed and have a deep-seated hatred for anyone who is different from them, especially Jews. I remember one conversation I had with her great uncle, a man who, I kid you not, had a Hitler mustache. ‘If you are going to be a part of this family you have to understand what we are planning. This is not some sad, little nursing home for the Nazi way of life to die, it is merely an incubator.’”

We broke off the engagement when I told her that my uncle had married a Jewish girl in the 1970s....

I have a Shark IQ with auto-empty. The little guy has been cleaning around 1500 sq ft *daily* for the past 520 days like a champ. Doesnt get stuck on vent covers or between chair legs. Hasn't fallen down any stairs.

It uses camera based navigation that isn't as accurate as laser mapping, but its not too bad. I'd say it might miss a small area once every 4-5 runs. The newer revision has added a second camera that apparently helps. It has never failed to return to its dock to recharge or resume from where it left off afterwards.

Auto-empty is the best thing ever. After every run it empties itself into a large bin attached to the charging dock. I empty the bin every 2 months or so.

As far as student loans being a positive for building credit, I mean, yes, that's a thing. But there are definitely others ways to do that. Starter credit cards, small personal loan, then maybe a small-is car loan. The credit system is flawed, but big student loans aren't the solution.

My biggest issue with what you're saying is ""unable to pay off their debt if they chose a reasonable degree"" It's not just about being unable to pay the debt off, although that's certainly an issue. It's bigger than that. It's the pressure that such a large costs adds.

We need a well educated population in may areas. We need artists, scientists, social workers , teachers, doctors, museum curators, civil engineers. And tons of other jobs. With college being so expensive, it's hard to justify going to school for 5+ years to get a masters in social work if you'll make 40K a year. It's hard to justify going for an education degree if you'll start at 32K a year (which was my experience in Arizona). But we need those people. We need museum curators, but if you're taking out a loan for that program, it's hard to justify going into a lower paying field, even if on a society level, we need those position.

“Your dog misses you, why don’t you visit”

After I got broken up with and needed a shoulder she said “you’ll get over it” with 0% sympathy. 

“I gave you the gift of life” Wow, I really wish you hadn’t, because living in apartments and trailers while still barely scrapping by isn’t what I would call a good life. 

While I was still unemployed and in high school she would occasionally some into my room when I was trying to sleep and go on and on and on about grandkids, despite the fact that I barely talked to girls because of a recent break up. On top of accusing me of sleeping with a girl in my room when I was 16 when we were only cuddling under my blanket. I didn’t lose my virginity till I was 21. 

Occasionally I’d write suicide notes to get all my feelings out, to see who I’d effect and just to get all the negativity out, and usually threw the notes away once everything subsided. There was one time I forgot and she found it what she said hurt, a lot. “I can’t afford a funeral” in a matter of fact, only thinking about the money kind of tone. 

“You’ll always stay with me right?” 

When I opened up to her about my sexuality and being Bi, she said “it’s just a phase”. I said the same thing to my brother a few years later and he said “cool, want another beer?”

I had a friend, who looked a lot like my older brother when he was around that age. She absolutely hated him, anytime he was around she’d be the most toxic person I’ve ever met. Granted the kid was a loudmouth, and could come across as a bully in the wrong light, he was a good kid. I didn’t realize this until I was an adult. 

In her defense, she’s definitely the black sheep of the family and she was abused from a young age. However you shouldn’t put all of your problems onto your kids, or recite the same stories of abuse to them over and over again until they question the validity when small details change. Being a single mom and working fast food is rough, I get it.

I have issues with her and will never call her mom again, because other female figures in my life have earned that title more than she has in my eyes.

Chuck, Tito, Rich Franklin, Bas Rutten, Mark Coleman, a lot of mid-level guys, a few refs and ring card girls.  If you hang around the strip during a fight weekend, you're bound to run into a few fighters.  I've gone to a few of the expos as well.  Of the more memorable ones--Matt Hughes was great because he was my favorite fighter when I was really into UFC, and despite what I had heard secondhand, he was really cool and appreciative.  Cowboy Cerrone was also very friendly and much bigger in person.  Razor Rob McCollough and Max Holloway were both very gracious and happy to be recognized.  A friend of mine spotted Edith Labelle a few years removed from UFC and she was really happy to be remembered as well.  Across the board everyone I've met from MMA was nice.  Phil Davis had kind of an awkward interaction with my brother, but I had met him once before that and he was totally cool, so that may have been my brother's fault.

For wrestlers, it's mostly late 90s ECW guys, as I went to a lot of the shows back then.  Tommy Dreamer spent like an hour with fans, talking and posing for pictures even though we caught him as he was leaving.  I actually felt guilty for spotting him because after he briefly chatted with my group, he probably felt like he had to do the same with everyone, and he had had a rough match that night and looked like he just wanted to crawl into bed.  At one show, I remember New Jack briefly signing a few autographs and then as he was leaving, some little girl called out, ""New Jack, I love you!"" and I swear to God he turned around and said, ""I love you too!"" and ran back and picked her up and gave her a Disney spinning hug.  

I also went to a lot of ROH shows in the mid 2000s in NYC at Basketball City and later the Manhattan Center, so I've met a few of those guys, but mostly just briefly.  I do remember once while we were in line outside, KENTA came out and just walked around talking to people on line.  I think it was one of his first shows there.  Another time Julius Smokes got off the bus, a regular MTA bus, in front of the arena and immediately went into his ""Yeah yeah yeah!"" shtick, but then I briefly spoke to him later in the show and he was shockingly normal.  I took my girlfriend at the time to one show and we saw Jim Cornette on the way to concessions, and I said, ""Mr. Cornette, how are ya, sir?"" and he fired back, ""How you doin, buddy?"" and my gf asked if he was my neighbor.

Watched the Office, didn't laugh once. Watched TBBT and Friends and laughed a few times.

I absolutely abhor democracy of any kind on the principle that that the majority of people can't make good decisions for themselves, let alone for the collective.

Think that there more bad people in the world than good ones.

Find Cardi B music, Tiktok and many other things reddit hates that don't really hurt anybody to be okay or at least nothing to be upset about or bothered by.

Don't hate Michael Bay movies.

Think the vast majority of redditors don't know a lot of people and have a very limited understanding of the human experience, often labeling people into simple classes that don't correlate with the real world.

Don't give a shit about character development, plot consistency, logic or realism in movies, bad cgi or anything like that. As long as I laugh or I don't wanna look at my phone, I find the movie or series to be good.

""You will never understand me.""

I was an introverted kid when growing up, I was socially akward aswell and I didn't know how to have a normal conversation with other kids. I was getting bullied alot for it and learned that if I keep things to myself, less harm will come my way.

Thanks to the years of drama club and some amazing people I met there, I changed from an introvert to a person who can start up conversations with strangers with ease. But it didn't change the way of how I bottle things inside me.

To mom I always seem like I don't care about anything and that I'm always calm in hard situations ""like an alien"".

It started pissing me off when I knew very well that it's not like that, but whenever I stand up for myself, she looks shocked and starts getting more angry at me for talking back. It's like if I'm not acting as I did when I was 12 (shy, quiet, doesn't talk and doesn't get involved), she thinks I'm a completely different person, out of this world. 

I think I got a bit off amd ranted a bit, sorry for that. 
In conclusion:

Don't push your kid away from you when you're having a hard time, they care for you and always want to help, by saying they'll never understand, you're not helping them or yourself.",,,1619303971,{},gvrawff,False,t3_mxf4dl,False,True,t3_mxf4dl,/r/AskReddit/comments/mxf4dl/what_is_the_most_toxic_thing_a_parent_can_say_to/gvrawff/,1619320414,1,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

when exactly? also, you kind of are to the point where its frightening. i just came here to tell you how to be more persuasive to people who aren't vegans and your hostility is basically leaking off the page.



""First can I ascertain, are you vegan? Just want to clarify""
assume I only eat meat. or assume i am vegan. would that change how you approach the conversation? would i get labeled as a demon or an ally in your mind?



""The whole ‘baby murderer’ thing isn’t an apt description because most people don’t view a foetus as a baby""
plenty of people do. and many people don't feel animals have the same rights as humans. you should know that by now given your online experience. i am telling you how to work around that difference to help make those values more normalized. 




""I didn’t ask for your advice, I’m not trying to sell you something""
if that's the case, what is it that you do online 99% of the time? pick fights and troll with no end goal? 



""most people have basic values not to rape/torture/abuse/murder others for no good reason""
basic values against their own kind. murdering animals that are traditionally eaten as food? there is no basic universal value shared for this. i'm not going to drive over to my friends farm and preach to him and his family to not eat animal/animal products. unless its something universal, there is no guarantee people will grow up with the same values or develop the same values. 




"" the vegan that’s actually turned the most people vegan (Gary Yourofsky) is abrasive as fuck so what you’re saying is not actually rooted in reality.""

because people shared the same values with respect to animals. either that, or they lacked exposure into food manufacturing completely. most of the people you talk (argue) with do not hold your values, they are also aware of how products are made by now. you won't get much farther by preaching unshared values; did you actually convince anyone?",,,1619303962,{},gvravt2,False,t3_mvc7ra,False,False,t1_gvr4i6n,/r/AskReddit/comments/mvc7ra/what_was_a_disturbing_sign_that_your_friend_might/gvravt2/,1619320404,1,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

Monster has always been known for selling $5 cables for $100, and they were frequently lower quality than the $5 cables.

She came into my room on my birthday, I was grounded for taking food when they didn’t give it to me. They never gave me food, I always scrounged for it due to me being the literal term, a bastard. My half brother was able to have some, but I was not. She came to my room and stated she wish she wouldn’t have listened to everyone and had gotten the abortion. This was in 2002.

Christopher Brown and Robyn F. (Rihanna) have been involved in a dating relationship for approx one and half years. On Sunday, February 8, 2009 at 0025 hours, Brown was driving a vehicle with Robyn F. as the front passenger on an unknown street in Los Angeles. Robin F. picked up Brown’s cellular telephone and observed a three page text message from a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with. A verbal argument ensued and Brown pulled the vehicle over on an unknown street, reached over Robyn F. with his right hand, opened the car door and attempted to force her out. Brown was unable to force Robyn F. out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit he took his right hand and shoved her head against the passenger window of the vehicle causing an approximate one inch raised circular contusion. Robyn F. turned to face Brown and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand. He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F’s mouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle.

Brown looked at Robyn F. and stated, “I am going to beat the shit out of you when we get home! You wait and see!” Robyn F. picked her cellular telephone and called her personal assistant, Jennifer Rosales at [redacted]. Rosales did not answer the telephone but while her voicemail greeting was playing, Robyn F. pretended to talk to her and stated, “I’m on my way home. Make sure the cops are there when I get there.” (This statement was made while the greeting was playing and was not captured as a message). After Robyn F. faked the call, Brown and looked at her and stated, “You just did the stupidest thing ever! Now I’m really going to kill you.” Brown resumed punching Robyn F. and she interlocked her fingers behind her head and brought her elbows forward to protect her face. She then bent over at the waist, placing her elbows and face near her lap in attempt to protect her face and head from the barrage of punches being levied upon her by Brown. Brown continued to punch Robyn F. on her left arm and hand causing her to suffer a contusion on her left triceps that was approximately two inches in diameter and numerous contusions on her left hand. Robyn F. then attempted to send a text message to her other personal assistant, Melissa Ford. Brown snatched the cellular telephone out of her hand and threw it out of the window onto an unknown street.

Brown continued driving and Robyn F. observed his cellular phone sitting in his lap. She picked up the cellular telephone with her left hand and before she could make a call he placed her in a head lock with his right hand and continued to drive the vehicle with his left hand. Brown pulled Robyn F. close to him and bit her on her left ear. She was able to feel the vehicle swerving from right to left as Brown sped away. He stopped the vehicle in front of [redacted] and Robyn F. turned off the car, removed the key from the ignition and sat on it. Brown did not know what she did with the key and began punching her in the face and arms. He then placed her in a head lock positioning the front of her throat between his bicep and forearm. Brown began applying pressure to Robyn F’s. left and right carotid arteries causing her to be unable to breathe and she began to lose consciousness. She reached up with her left hand and began attempting to gauge his eyes in an attempt to free herself. Brown bit her left ring and middle fingers and then released her. While Brown continued to punch her, she turned around and placed her back against the passenger door. She brought her knees to her chest, placed her feet against Brown’s body and began pushing him away. Brown continued to punch her on the legs and feet causing several contusions. Robyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighborhood heard Robyn F.’s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F. was issued a Domestic Violence Emergency Protective Order (EPO).",,,1619303809,{},gvralb4,False,t3_mxnf10,False,False,t1_gvrafcu,/r/AskReddit/comments/mxnf10/what_is_the_most_overrated_product_youve_purchased/gvralb4/,1619320245,8,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

In my opinion,, there’s many toxic things a parent can say to a child. It’s down to how the child handles it and their mental health. &lt;33",,,1619303802,{},gvraksn,False,t3_mxf4dl,False,True,t3_mxf4dl,/r/AskReddit/comments/mxf4dl/what_is_the_most_toxic_thing_a_parent_can_say_to/gvraksn/,1619320237,1,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

 The only redeeming feature the watch had was that I could use Spotify offline on the watch  and save playlists to it which meant I didn't have to take my phone with me when exercising but recently they took away that feature so now I completely regret my purchase and wish I could get my money back.

I just use it in an embedded home server to redirect http requests and P2P networking to an arbitrary country. Nord is the only provider that lets me use OpenVPN profiles over UDP and doesn't necessitate getting a new .ovpn profile every week because they decided to scramble something. Every other provider I've tried either breaks my connection after around a week or requires using their own proprietary client, which I can't do on my custom Debian server. For sensitive information I use Mullvad but for my less security-minded processes, Nord works well.

Also, the security concerns for Nord have been overblown. Everyone cites the server compromise but it was an out of commission exit node that didn't have anything sensitive on it.

Like I said, it's good to be a smart consumer but at the end of the day nearly every VPN service is going to have some issues and sometimes ""good enough"" really is ""good enough.""",,,1619303782,{},gvrajfn,False,t3_mxnf10,False,False,t1_gvr8zdb,/r/AskReddit/comments/mxnf10/what_is_the_most_overrated_product_youve_purchased/gvrajfn/,1619320216,23,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

I met an attractive guy at a surprisingly uneventful party in New York at the end of last year.  I was drunk, horny and very eager to get fucked hard so I gladly agreed when he asked me to come home with him. 

When we arrived at his place and started messing around, he told me he was into dominant women and being humiliated and that he thought I would make a great dom. Even though I'm not at all into submissive men (quite the contrary), I was feeling generous and wanted to make the most of the evening. He was so excited too, that I simply didn't have the heart to tell him no, so I stayed over and bossed him around a bit, made him worship my stilettos, slapped him repeatedly, called him humiliating names and jerked him off a bit. He was suuuper into it, but I was honestly bored out of my mind by the end and I kept waiting for him to cum. When he did, I asked him to call me an Uber and I proceeded to leave.

As I was on my way out, I noticed his flatmates had a guest over, who was a shady dealer and there was some sort of lame, lowkey party going on. They asked me to stay and do ""cocaine"" with them for free, which, lets be honest, I was never going to turn down. Straight away I noticed that it wasn't cocaine, but proceeded to take it anyway. Not long after, I started having a really bad trip and went into full panic mode when the dealer told us that it was fucking KETAMINE and not actual cocaine. One of his flatmates puked all over himself and was knocked out in the bathtub from the drugs and alcohol while the other one was freaking out and hyperventilating in the corner since his trip was even worse than mine and fell into a really bad k-hole. All the while, the dealer was hitting on me and continuously trying to touch me inappropriately, putting his hands up my skirt while I was floating between consciousness and could barely move. The whole night just spiraled into a complete nightmare. He had undone my bra by the time I regained consciousness.

Eventually I sobered up enough to storm off as quickly as I could while still high as fuck at 4:30am and realized my battery had died and I had no money so I had to walk an hour and a half back to my place in freezing temperatures. I somehow made it home alive thankfully.",,,1619303727,{},gvrafoo,False,t3_mxumih,False,True,t3_mxumih,/r/AskReddit/comments/mxumih/whats_the_creepiest_thing_a_person_has_ever_said/gvrafoo/,1619320158,3,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

No, you don't. That was never the point of cable, outside of channels like HBO.

Originally, there were only a few channels that one had access to, all of them over-the-air. Say, NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX, PBS, and maybe one or two more, if you're lucky. Then when cable came about, people went, ""Wow, by paying a subscription, I can get access to a hundred more channels!"". These channels still had ads.

With the rise of streaming services (which do not typically have ads if you're paying for them), ordinary cable TV seems out of place, and is receding in popularity as a result.

It's pretty annoying to have it running in the same room as you, but you can still have a conversation or watch TV. You might have to speak up a bit, but you wouldn't have to yell.

When it's in another room, you can still hear it, but it's pretty quiet. 

If it's running on carpet, you can probably knock 20 decibels off. 

I live in a one bedroom apartment, and I'll sometimes forget that it's running. If I'm in the living room, and it's cleaning the bedroom (which is carpeted), I can't hear it at all. Dead silent. I can only tell it's still running when it leaves the bedroom and starts coming back down the hall.

If I lived in a two story house and slept upstairs, I would have no issues running it at night.

The thing that scares me is one of them was a neck hammock (which I still want, a real one that is).  When it arrived it didn't look anything like the picture.  I hooked it up to a door knob as instructed and before putting any weight on it I decided it looked too flimsy to be effective.  So using my hand I gently pushed down on it to test it and one of the elastics snapped.

Hmm let's see,

-beaten with a belt whenever I disobeyed, didn't follow rules, anything I did that made her mad, including bad grades and lying.  Not allowed to play with the neighbors kids when she was not home (she was a single mom working a 9-5 job until I was 12 so I was always home alone so of course I went to play with the other kids, the other kids would also come to the door and coax me out to play) she would come home, find out chase me and then whip me with a belt.

-forced to eat soap when lying or had jalapenos rubbed on my mouth

-purity culture

-called names: pig, fat, lazy, my bio dad's name as an insult
Along with squeezing my stomach and laughing, asking me why I don't workout, telling me I should workout or should lose weight (I actually became anorexic my junior year of highschool as a slow suicide and it would've worked if my counselor hadn't intervened). 

-searching my room to steal and snoop through my journals and then crying and lecturing me (with my stepdad) about how awful it was that I called her a bitch and that I hated her in pen)

-taking my phone away

-hiding the house phones so I couldn't talk to anyone or my boyfriend for weeks at a time

-hitting/throwing stuff/ yelling at me when she found out I had sex for the first time

-hitting me everytime someone got child services involved (they never did anything to help me)

-whenever we had a screaming match and I started to hyperventilate my stepdad would pin me to the ground and not let me up

-same step dad also never really intervened to get her to stop or tell her what she was doing was wrong.

-coming into my room while I'm practicing tracing and ripping apart my drawings and then telling at me for not doing math or science.

-stepdad telling me that (at this rate because I struggled with school) my only chance for success would be to marry a man with money and hope he can take care of me

-same step dad telling me that sending panty/bra pics to my boyfriend was like taunting a dog with raw meat

-not helping fund college because they didn't think I would keep up with it and that the money would be wasted

-not believing me when I told them I couldn't get financial aid until I was 23 because my step dad made too much money  

Stepdad comparing his situation financially and how he managed to fund himself debt free all the way to grad school and that I wasn't trying hard enough (I made 7.25 an hour at age 18 in a grocery store not to mention my mother wanted me to pay $300 for rent, if I was lucky I would make $400 every two weeks)

-threatening to put my head in the toilet (only reason it didn't happen was because her mother who was visiting at the time stopped her, I was like 5 or 6)

So now you have a vacuum that takes an hour or two.. doesn't get everywhere.. and in the end you have to empty it and clean it anyway (Hairs get wrapped around the brush which need to be removed).

For the same space I took about 10-15 minutes to properly vacuum the whole place per hand.

You are absolutely right about the love and care they took with every scene of the film. Everything from direction, acting, art/set/costume/etc. was top notch and it was visually stunning. Music and score too.

I think the plot lines of DiCaprio's decline and Pitt's run in with the Manson family did not match up at all and the overall pacing was just off to me. It felt to me like a very incoherent mashup of a variety of Hollywood scenes and gags, which as I write this I realize might have been part of the whole point of the film?

When I watch something like Django, I think of the how Tarantino plays with tension throughout the entire Candy Land sequence. Constantly building tension, then loosening its grip only to squeeze harder and harder over and over until you finally get that gun shot from Dr. Shultz finally releasing it all in one singular moment. None of that skill is shown off in Once Upon A Time at all because it is so disjointed to me. That is not to say that Once Upon A Time needed to have that same energy or emotion; it is a very different emotional space from any of Tarantino's other films imo. There just seemed to be a lack of any cohesion in the film from scene to scene or in any of the characters outside of DiCaprio and Pitt. Everything seemed confusing and just really off. 

I am sure I had a very emotional reaction to all of that when I first saw it. I had very high expectations of Once Upon A Time In Hollywood and I hope that when I revisit it I can see it in a better light. Thanks again for sharing with me! Cheers!

Doesnt matter that you smile and speak in a pleasant tone of voice. You are actively going out of your way to prevent an employee from doing their (only) assigned task and putting them in an uncomfortable situation with their employer. 

A prime example: my retail shop has a clear sign saying mask required for entry. I have a regular who is generally a super sweet lady that I've helped for 2 years now. But ever since covid she comes in every week without a mask, no matter how many times we provide her with and ask her to wear one. Yea shes polite and pleasant to interact with outside of that, but shes still being selfish and inconsiderate of me trying to do my job in the manner my company expects and I've lost respect for her as a result. If break the rules for one customer, regardless of how nice they are, then I open myself up to more customers trying to take advantage. 
Same goes for IDs. I check IDs on every single guest because that's what I've been instructed to do. Idgaf if your 60 and have grey hair. You can give me your ID at the register, or you can go home with nothing. Yea I could override the ID scanner for someone who's clearly an adult, but my employer doesnt like when we do that and the second I let it slide once, the customer will continue to come with no ID until I begin to refuse sales. 

It is a matter of consistency.

He had been a big, twitchy guy with veiny skin stretched over swollen biceps, a tattoo of a swastika on his tongue. Teeth filed into razor-sharp fangs-you know the type. And you’re chopping off his head because, even with eight bullet holes in him, you’re pretty sure he’s about to spring back to his feet and eat the look of terror right off your face.

On the follow-through of the last swing, though, the handle of the ax snaps in a spray of splinters. You now have a broken ax. So, after a long night of looking for a place to dump the man and his head, you take a trip into town with your ax. You go to the hardware store, explaining away the dark reddish stains on the broken handle as barbecue sauce. You walk out with a brand-new handle for your ax.

The repaired ax sits undisturbed in your garage until the spring when, on one rainy morning, you find in your kitchen a creature that appears to be a foot-long slug with a bulging egg sac on its tail. Its jaws bite one of your forks in half with what seems like very little effort. You grab your trusty ax and chop the thing into several pieces. On the last blow, however, the ax strikes a metal leg of the overturned kitchen table and chips out a notch right in the middle of the blade.

Of course, a chipped head means yet another trip to the hardware store. They sell you a brand-new head for your ax. As soon as you get home, you meet the reanimated body of the guy you beheaded earlier. He’s also got a new head, stitched on with what looks like plastic weed-trimmer line, and it’s wearing that unique expression of “you’re the man who killed me last winter” resentment that one so rarely encounters in everyday life.

You brandish your ax. The guy takes a long look at the weapon with his squishy, rotting eyes and in a gargly voice he screams, “That’s the same ax that beheaded me!”
