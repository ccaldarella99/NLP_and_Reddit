I kicked my sister into a wall and she fell through it (it was a wall divider so not a actual wall)

I repeatedly banged my chin onto my friends shoulder while she was “holding me down” to stop me from bashing myself in the face

---------|----------|----------|
What do you think about blm?|Great message that was twisted by people who had other ideas. I’m all for protest and speech and all that. 100%. I’ll even get my ass o it there with you. Mob mentality is a dangerous thing though. Unfortunately that’s what came o in a lot of places. Not all. We had our own sizable demonstrations that stayed peaceful and were given a lot of freedom to make their message heard. Not everywhere was so lucky. Peaceful ones don’t make headlines.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq3787/)
Has your job affected any relationships with friends/family? Especially now I know that being a cop can affect people’s views.|Absolutely, but not much more than being in the military effected it. Relationships are weird being a cop. Everyone like to point it out, which is kind of a pain in the ass. “Oh shit the cops are here. Hahaha”. I just want to get a burger. Don’t call me out like that. Also really weird schedules. My close relationship me are fine. My wife is really supportive and knows I have some unique experience regularly. Like some times I just need to come home and be alone. Sometimes it’s let me take a quick shower and let’s go to dinner. My close friends are the same.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq45vo/)
With the way things have been lately, how do you deal with the stress that any call can go sideways? Do you approach the situation on the alert or deal with things in the moment?|Both? All this is nothing new to cops. I’ve only been on road for five years but it’s always been this. A welfare check on a house could be someone butt dialed 911 or there is an active aggravated assault. The car you pulled over swerving could be someone who dropped a coffee in their lap or a drunk guy with a suspended license, two active warrants and a gun. You almost become relaxed in you state of alert. That’s normal. That’s why departments are really pushing a lot of tools used by the military to decompress mentality. I’m very fortunate that my pd has those programs and I brought mine from the army.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq4rka/)
I'm a British Police Authorised Firearms Officer, I'm curious how long your training and your probationary period was?|Total in-house and academy training was about 10 months. Field training was four months. Then 12 months of a fairly in depth probationary period. Other departments are different but they follow the same general timeline.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq7pzs/)
American?|Yes|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq30n0/)
What’s the best part of the job? The worst part?|Kids. Happy kids are awesome. Hurt kids put my head in a weird place.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq3aqs/)
In your opinion, why are fellow officers unwilling/unable to stop other officers from doing absolutely shady and illegal things?|I have no idea. I’ve never seen it. In fact I’ve never really seen any officer try to pull shady shit. I know that’s not really the answer you’re looking for but I can’t really give you one. Maybe I work in a fucking magical land of policing but my department is totally cool with calling others out. Internal investigation is a pretty common thing. Usually it’s a misunderstanding or only hearing half the story. If some shady shit is going down that stops quick.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq3cic/)
Also, living in the south are there any incidents that have occurred/you’ve responded to that are unique to the area?|Not really. We’re near a military base and a (kind of) large university so our population is really diverse. I guess that would be the unusual part of my area.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq3fu2/)
Do you have a favorite cop movie?|Hot Fuzz. No question.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq3ma4/)
do you watch brooklyn nine-nine?|I have been told so many times to watch it but I just can’t get into it. I’m not a big tv show guy anymore.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq47ob/)
What are your thoughts on qualified immunity?|I think qualified immunity should stay. If I were to do something on duty, I am as tiny as a member of the department. I can’t make personal statement. I can’t make personal decisions. Everything I do represents the department. If someone fucks up, the department fucked up by giving them that authority. Go after the department, not the individual. That is not a defense of anyone in particular. Just a personal stance.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq6ux4/)
What do you believe should be done to improve relations between the police and the public?|This. Or things like this. Talking. I change of ideas. Cops are more than a badge. People are more than suspects or victims. Talking won’t solve anything but it’s a damn good place to start.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq7hq7/)

It’s sad because I was raised by traditional and religious parents.

I always say there's a difference between knowledge and wisdom. People are encouraged to gain all kinds of knowledge in Islam but aren't learning the wisdom behind things. Like we memorize verses and teach kids to memorize them but sometimes fail to understand the meaning and the purpose behind these ayat, so we're essentially becoming parrots who just repeat.

And like what you mentioned things about manners. There tends to be people who even though they are praying 5 times, fasting and doing whatever we should be doing, but still have rude attitudes and our character is not matching Islam and doesn't resemble the character of the prophets. Since the prophet muhammad. alayhi salaat wa salaam, said ""whoever is better in manners is better in religion"", it seems to be a big issue that we need to address more.

I think when there are muslims who are only muslim by name see the muslim who does practice certain things but is rude or judgemental it can be very discouraging for them to want to have Islam in their lives more. We are not The Most Just of Judges, and if we were given other peoples lives we may have made worse decisions with them.

I really like your point on discussions with peoples concerns or fears in religion especially young people. We should be more open to controversial subjects, that's the only way we'll understand how to get through them. Also certain subjects in Islam that seem controversial when you are uninformed, but once you do become informed are not controversial at all. Let's talk about the hard things and not shy away from them.

Like After I have a tic attack I’m super tired and sore. But what sucks the most is when I have to get sedated because of me punching myself in my face. it’s almost like I’m extremely tired but I cannot sleep. No matter how much I tried I couldn’t sleep but I was way to tired to do anything so I just had to lay there for what felt like days because I was so out of it. Anytime  someone tried to talk to me I was confused and disoriented. But then when I finally got to sleep I slept for 21 hours straight. But for the next two days I’m was still extremely tired but able to make it through the day. 

Another consequence is I throw up, which I hate. 
I have a tic that stops me from breathing for a period of time and after it was over I threw up so much. It was terrible.

When I have a paralysis tic my body is constantly going limp, then I get back up, then I’m back down. So my head is moving quite fast in a short period of time which makes me extremely sick. 

I have a laughing tic (which happens to be my favourite tic) but a side effect of that is I throw up. For some strange reason, because I can’t have one good thing.

Women orgasm from clitoral stimulation. Most women only from clitoral stimulation. It has the most nerves and is the most sensitive part of her body. Look up a picture of the clitoris — the pea-sized “button” people talk about is just a fraction of the clitoris, it is a larger element than people realize.

This means that penetrative sex needs to also stimulate her, potentially with fingers or a toy that is curved. Women orgasm from clitoral stimulation the most, then vaginal penetration, then anal penetration. Some women report orgasm from breast stimulation alone. 

It can seem like men need to get their partners off with their penis, but that’s a stereotype about masculinity and misinformation about how sex works for people. 

Using your hands while penetrating is like frying and egg in one pan with one hand and writing down a manifesto in the other. It’s really hard to do both of those things at once — the clitoral stimulation will be less orgasmic. You might try having her hold a vibratos while you penetrate her — that’s considered the holy grail of achieving mutual orgasm.

I will say to you, good sir, if you are making a girl orgasm from oral sex, you are doing it right and you are a stand out from the crowd.

1) The female orgasm is incredibly powerful and quite literally exhausting. It is more powerful and longer lasting than the male orgasm, so exhaustion makes a lot of sense. You can also enjoy g-spot arousal without orgasming from it. Or potentially g-spot stimulation combined with someone else. All of that is normal and depends on the person. Some people find clitoral stimulation their best route to orgasm, but how intense their clit feels arousal will vary. That’s why some girls cannot do vibrators and others love them.

2) What kind of porn does your partner watch and why does it make you somewhat uncomfy? If you are uncomfortable with the kind of porn he likes, definitely talk it through. If you are insecure about your body from the women of porn (this is the most likely from our research, although not always true!), then definitely work through that. If your partner is using porn to replace you, then that’s an issue to take to a therapist together....or if he has a porn addiction as you can see. 

When people watch porn, it isn’t cheating and it is healthy and normal as long as in moderation and not with content that disturbs one or the other partner. Your partner probably has used porn more regularly for sex than other things.

That is a really good question! And one that I have thought about and discussed a lot with my family 

So here's my take on it, I think that we should try to focus on the principles of Islam rather than the minor details that a lot of Sheikhs and Muslims seem to be focusing on today, so we should be more concerned with community support and giving out Zaka and Sadaqat and finding ways to help others rather than focus on what women should be wearing or what medicines break the fast, even though those issues are important, they shouldn't be the main focus

We should be looking into leading with our behavior and mannerism, to let our Islam show through our good actions and forgiveness and tolerance, to read Quran and try to understand it every time, not just read it to increase the number of times you finished reading it. 

To allow discussions regarding religion, especially with young people, let them speak out their fears and concerns and insecurities about religion, and help them understand them and overcome them rather than shut them down and saying that's Haram you shouldn't say that 

These are just a few of the thoughts I have on this topic, but I believe Allah will guide us if we truly wish to do the right thing for the sake of Islam

Even in Sunna and Quran terrorism is not condoned

My only explanation for their behavior is that they were brainwashed by some group into thinking this somehow is the right thing to do, or filled with hate speech against ""Non-muslims"" and therefore resort to violence 

Yes Allah knows what's in our hearts and minds, he will judge us according to our actions and intentions individually. 

As for the Haddith, you can know to a certain degree which ones are legit because there is a field of study that relates to sunna and how trustworthy a haddith is based on who transcribed it or told it to others until now, they study the history of each of these people, if they were good people, weren't known for lying or committing bad acts then they consider their efforts honest. It also has to do with what's in the haddith and if it contradicts what's in the Quran and Shari'a 

I don't know much about salafists to be honest, but from what i know, they decide to live by the rules of the prophet's time and refuse to have anything adapted to today's world, which in my opinion isn't practical. But like you said everyone tries to follow what they think is right, Allah will judge in his own, just way


Yes definitely prefer us to study religion, but of course there is a difference between studying religion with the intention of understanding and then studying religion and discarding whatever doesn't fit with our own beliefs or mindset. 

So I will say this, if you would like to study religion, then please do so with an open mind and ask Allah to help guide you to the truth and he will inshallah, and try to read from different sources if you're not sure which one is right, sometimes if you compare between what's in the Quran, what's reasonable to our minds, what's in the Haddith and the spirit of Islam in general you will be able to find the truth between all the sources",,,1619268244,{},gvorlhu,True,t3_mx9hdk,False,True,t1_gvoh88a,/r/AMA/comments/mx9hdk/im_a_religious_muslim_female_and_an_arab_ama/gvorlhu/,1619275615,2,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],,

I’m a 40 yo woman who is happily married to a man. My sex drive has been low for years and it worries me. When I was younger (teens through young adulthood probably into around 25-30 ish) my drive was stronger. I would be around a partner and feel horny and things would progress. 

Now (since about my early to mid 30’s) it’s different. I am able to experience arousal with my husband and come to orgasm by him or when I masturbate but my overall drive is very low and I am never “in the mood”. 

Basically I can be worked up and we’ve worked together to find out what works for me and what brings me to arousal but it’s a bit of a job and can feel like a chore that needs to get started. Once I’m aroused I have a great time. 

Is it normal to not feel the impulse to get started? I want it for myself but also because I love my husband and want to bring him joy too. The fact that it takes work even to feel arousal to begin things means that I am never in the mood and we have sex less frequently or spontaneously.

It doesn't serve the same purpose for women, in the case of women it would only be about lust as having more than one partner serves no other purpose. 

But you should know that there are conditions for having more than one wife, they must treat them equally when it comes to spending and responsibility as well as spending time with them, otherwise they might be committing injustice which god warns about in the Quran and that it will have its own punishment

So it might be considered a perk, but it's also a big responsibility, that unfortunately some men aren't taking seriously

Mainly, my life is not worth the job. I'm a white male. I was viewed more negatively for that than the actual people we kept off the street. I ended up working in REACT (sex offenders) and that's probably even worse. 

2.   In a city of over 14 million, and less than 50k officers, do you feel you were adequately equipped for whatever situations occured during a shift? 

I never felt like I wasn't equipped. We always had the best response time and could rely on other agencies to provide support like LACS.

3.   In your experience, were new-hires with a college degree better officers? If so, do you think it should be a requirement?

I actually have my Master's degree. I don't think I've met another officer who didn't have a degree. I don't think they'd seriously consider someone without one. You have to know how to read and write at a high level. Misspelling a word can lead to a lot of problems. A lot people who end up in law enforcement and went to nice colleges usually end up working for the feds.

4.    In your experience, do you feel bodycams are a hinderence to your day-to-day work, or do you feel the keep the borderline cops in line? What is your personal opinion on civilian oversight of officer involved shootings? 

As a citizen and cop, ALL cops should have body cams. It helps us more. We get a lot of complaints about people being mistreated by cops and it's the body cams that clears them. 

5.   In regards to training, do you feel the initial training and follow-on training prepares you for the vast situations you might encounter in such a large metropolitan city? If inadequate, I'd be curious as to what your recommendations are. 

I think we handled the protests and pandemic well. If we had a massive quake, then I would be very worried.

6.     Lastly, with regard to your personal mental health and that of your fellow officers, do you feel the work environment is supportive of seeking a therapist, and/or do they provide one? 

Not really, but you get used to it. It also depends on your personality. I can stomach dealing with child molesters but probably couldn't deal with working in a jail like the sheriff's do.

7.      Im current military considering a career with the FBI after this tour, and while I know Federal vastly differs from local LE, I want to be able to make that transition with open eyes and as informed as possible. 

That's a tricky one. A lot of the vets find it very hard to transition to being an officer. They tend to be the ones who look for ""action"" instead of deescalating situations.

Sometimes all I want to do is sleep and/or eat, other cycles like right now I’ll experience insomnia and/or loss of appetite. I know these things can be standard, I’m not describing it well enough to make it sound like a real issue. However, I have too many stories to recount of times when my PMS symptoms contributed to poor judgment or me doing or saying something foolish that has a noticeable effect on my work or home life.

What you want to do is to progressively pull more and more each time, and at some point the tip of your schamalamaladingdong will be entirely out. I recommend doing this over the course of a few days, slowly. Under the shower, for example.

Also, it's possible that, if you never ever pulled it back all the way, you'll have smegma on the tip of your dick, and the tip will be hyper sensitive. 
Smegma is, iirc, dead skin which stayed because lack of hygiene. Don't fear to wash it, it will hurt a little bit because of the sensitiveness of the penis, but you'll feel relieved like never before.

This makes the infrequent sexual encounters I have quite difficult, as oral sex doesnt stimulate me at all and I don't finish fur the duration of my erection.

Birth control can stop the ovaries from releasing eggs. If the ovaries don’t release an egg, there will be nothing for sperm to fertilize.

(2) Prevent Implantation 
In order for someone to be pregnant, the fertilized egg must implant on the uterine wall. Well, if birth control can prevent the implantation...then no pregnancy! This is also what Plan B does — it forces the lining of the uterus to shed.

(3) Hostile Sperm Environment

[],,saltyferret,,,[],,,,text,t2_7gvpt,False,False,[],"Man, I totally get how it can sometimes be easier to express anonymously online, and I hope it helped getting it all out in writing, sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now. I understand the desire to not want feel like you're burdening family or friends with what you're going through, I spoke to a psychologist for the first time last week for the same reason; having a non-judgemental outlet to pour everything out to can be liberating.

I won't pretend to fully understand everything your going through, we all have different journeys and experiences, but hopefully i can share a bit of wisdom I've learned along the way. Firstly don't be ashamed about feeling a bit desensitised to what your parents are going through, you need to look after yourself first and foremost. I guarantee you that if you try to take on their burdens as well it'll weigh heavy on you, and your parents would not want you to feel any additional stress or anxiety on their account. In fact, they could notice and start worrying about how you're doing as well. It's important that we deal with ourselves first before expending emotional energy on others, otherwise we're not helping anyone.

It's natural to take on different personsas around different people and groups. Everyone does it all the time, it doesn't mean that you're fake, it just means that you have social skills and can adjust in different settings. I'm totally different at work than I am with my friends (even different depending on which friends I'm hanging out with). You're still you at your core, nothing can take away from that. It's also natural for who you are to change over time, that's a good thing, it means you're evolving as a person. Remember, character is who we are when nobody else is watching. It's what we do when we're alone, and aren't trying to impress anybody other than ourselves.

The fact that you feel guilt is proof that you're not a sociopath. The best evidence that you're a good person is that you question whether you are. Evil people never wonder or care whether they are good or evil. Introspection is good, but you can't let it overwhelm you or get too much in your own head. Just try to do the next right thing whenever you have an opportunity.

With girls, it sounds a bit like you're trying to premptively protect yourself from rejection. You enjoy the chase, but as soon as it has the potential to become something more you automatically find a reason not to pursue it, because you might subconsciously be worried that it'll fail or that you'll be rejected, so you'd rather be the one to decide not to proceed, rather than risk the other person having the opportunity. The only cure to that is to just take the plunge. Relationships require vulnerability, it's scary, but no matter how it ends it's almost always worth taking the risk. Also a date is just a date, not a marriage proposal, if you guys don't connect then you haven't lost anything, don't put too much pressure on it.

If it's any consolation it sounds like you've got some pretty great date ideas, it'd be a shame if you don't give yourself a chance to try them out irl.

Someone could do an enema to clean the rectum and try to flush it out as best as possible. I don’t recommend doing this often. Honestly, a healthy bowel movement an hour or so before anal sex can be good enough.

It is possible for feces to come out during anal....it’s usually a small amount and that’s to be expected 🤷🏻‍♀️ But a bowel movement will generally not happen during anal sex unless there’s an issue with continence and like diarrhea.

Otherwise, if you try anal beads, you’ll feel how the insertion feels. It can have the sensation of “I might poop” but that’s similar to the feeling good after pooping itself...right?

So for anyone who identifies this way, there are two elements to address:
(1) The objectifying of women to the point men think they deserve a certain look is an issue, but more to the point is that about 5% of people look the way celebrities and Stacy’s look, so population wise, it isn’t going to work out. People cannot have rigid standards for sex and love — my partner needs to be _____ (insert laundry list). When you do that, you eliminate millions of possibilities.

Females, generally, have a regular cycle of about 28-32 days. During this cycle, here’s what happens: 

(1) The ovaries — which contain all of a female’s eggs, we are born with all of our eggs — will release a matured egg.

(2) That matured egg might have met with a sperm from ejaculation, but since it was not fertilized, the egg will fall through the uterus and actually out through the vagina. (Eggs are microscopic and we can’t see them!)

(3) While that egg was maturing, the uterus lining was building up with nutrients and blood, because that lining would be what a fertilized egg would need to survive as it develops into an embryo. 

(4) The egg falls through and the body realizes it doesn’t need that lining, so the uterus contracts and sheds its lining — that’s what period blood is, the shed lining of the uterus.

(5) Then the cycle starts again — 2 weeks of the egg maturing... a window of time when it is released (peak fertility/ovulation) and then the week when the body starts over, shedding the lining.",,,1619243275,{},gvnjghe,True,t3_mxan9q,False,False,t1_gvnhr3q,/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvnjghe/,1619256759,8,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],,

(1) The semen contains 300 million (give or take) sperm and those sperm are going to travel through the cervix, which is a portal to the uterus above the vagina. 

(2) Once through the cervix, the sperm will swim magnetically, almost, to the Fallopian tubes where they will look for a mature egg that has been released from the ovaries.

(3) The sperm that have survived at this point (they die along the way, it’s a tough journey) will gather around the egg and try to get the egg to meet with them. The egg and sperm kind of choose each other (fertilization), one sperm gets in most of the time and there’s one egg most of the time (if more than one sperm make it or more than one egg is present, you get twins and triplets).

It would be difficult to find such therapists in India probably. Very few people would be open to having a conversation about sex presumably. But your answer is reassuring nonetheless.

So yes there is a sense of shame that mostly results because I do not know if it is normal to have such thoughts. It's not a problem to others as such because I have not been able to open up about this to them, because well such conversations can be awkward and discomfiting. Probably religious exposure in childhood sort of contributes somewhat to making these thoughts a little tormenting sometimes. However it is a lot lesser than before, because I have come to accept them to some extent.

---------|----------|----------|
As the soon-to-be mom of a boy, when and how do you think my husband and I should start talking to my son about pornography? We plan to educate about sex early and often in age-appropriate ways, but I think the quick access of porn on the internet warrants its own special discussion. Or discussions.|Congratulations! You are thinking so far ahead and I can’t predict quite where technology and the internet will be...  However, it is really normal for kids to seek out information about sex and bodies throughout childhood and adolescence. If he is able to use a smartphone, the natural curiosity about bodies will be addressed with that phone as a tool.  So I tell people, be careful with what tools your children have and at what ages.  Pornography is everywhere. We use sex to sell everything and sex is everywhere. The worst thing you could do is pretend it doesn’t happen...so instead, start relationship, bodies and media literacy conversations early. Teach your son about what he sees and be a little cautious about what he watches and the messages therein.  Also, be careful with his friends. Boys will watch porn because they get introduced by someone, someone’s older brother. Don’t prevent your son from a social life, but before he goes and sleeps over somewhere, just know that porn is likely on the menu.  Age-wise, ball-park...about age 8-10. Children know about the internet, they know about gender and sex differences (by 2 years old). They will be able to handle it.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvn5qvj/)
Is oral unsanitary? I love to perform and receive but I often wonder if it's unhealthy to do so.|Yes. The mouth is full of plaque and bacteria. You can get literally ever STI from the mouth and transfer it with the mouth. Kissing is sexy? 80 million swapped bacteria is sexy? Ohhhh no.  Plus (depending on you and your partner) oral sex can cause yeast infections and you can wreck a girl’s ph balance with whatever you ate or smoked earlier. Brush your teeth, clean your tongue on the reg.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvn0i92/)
Why is blowing into a vagina dangerous but pushing air into the vagina (queef) isn't?|This is a great question. To start, a queef is when the air squeaks out of the vagina because air has been pushed in (not the pushing itself, but the sound it makes when air is squeezed out).  The vagina is a muscle, it will adapt, improvise and overcome. Physics dictates that an object placed inside another must replace whatever was there previously (air in this case). Thus, what causes queefing is just the erect penis replacing the air that had been “pushed” just so subtly, accompanied by vaginal lubrication.  If someone were to blow air into the vagina, that air pressure would then put pressure on the cervix — causing pain like IUDs or a fraction childbirth, basically.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvn18wp/)
Do kegels really work? Does it make sex better? I'm thinking about getting some Kegel balls.|The pelvic floor is incredibly important to female reproductive health and sexual pleasure. Pelvic floor surgeons and physical therapists work on kegel-type exercises, without the “pop culture” feel of “making me tighter” kinds of sexual matters, but more with working muscles to avoid vaginal pain.  But if you are considering kegels, I’m assuming you have a clitoris? Sex for you wouldn’t necessarily get better with kegal balls. You are better off strengthening the kegels with exercising or buy kegels balls just for the feeling/sensation.  So generally, no to kegal balls but yes to kegal muscles helping with your body!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvn34tk/)
Do all girls release fluid when they orgasm? If i didn't doss that mean i didn't orgasm?|Great question! There is no “all girls” do anything when it comes to orgasms, except that the female orgasm lasts much longer than men’s and is more powerful for longer.  The clenching and releasing feeling of and orgasm does not require liquid ejaculation. The “squirting” people see in pornography, is not average and regularly models drink water to pee clear and push it out with such pressure.  More common is increased vaginal lubrication for a moment (followed by some drier climates sometimes) or a few dribbles or ejaculation, not like an explosion.  You can absolutely orgasm without ejaculating anything! 👍🏻|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvn3o90/)
Is squirting actually pee &amp; is every woman capable of achieving whatever it is?|Great question! Squirting is not urine, although urine is regularly found in female ejaculate fluid. We don’t know enough about the female orgasm let alone ejaculate...however we do know that it is possible for a female to “squirt” and it is not the same consistency as urine.  Is every female capable? Perhaps physically, but arousal and pleasure are more about your brain than your physical body...so with such variance in women, I would say no, overall. Plus squirting is not something all women should try to emulate...it’s regularly shown in porn by women peeing after drinking only water for 24 hours and pushing it out really hard and fast.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvn4win/)
have any funny or strange stories from teaching? you seem like a great teacher !!|Hahaha mostly I get great questions from people. Some highlights:  - I once had a student who thought breasts weren’t supposed to move because they didn’t move in porn. His GF’s breasts were “liquid-filled” he said.  - I get asked at 9/10 sessions if it would be safe to use two condoms (for anyone reading, the answer is no. Rubber will create holes and pores, greater chances or tearing when rubbed against itself. Two condoms is less safe).  - I’ve had men/boys correct me when I said IUD. They are SURE I meant IED (birth control or a bomb...)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvn7adq/)
[deleted]|No. It is not. At all.  We are still unaware of all the additional STIs we would have to add from anal activity. The possibilities are endless with fecal matter.  Ass to mouth? Quite literally eating shit.  Would you put your cock inside a flashlight lined with poop flecks? Probably not...but into a girl who looks hot? Sure! The sanitation is the same, just wrapped up differently.  Don’t get me wrong, anal stimulation is top notch, but it would be sanitary to do with with gloves and finger covers, lots of hand washing. Condoms would be recommended...|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvn7n6d/)
Have any students ever been traumatised (for lack of a better word) from a class due to not knowing about the concept of sex prior to the course?|GREAT question. The answer is no — they have all at least seen kissing, heterosexual intimacy, at least. The “what goes on” part is me filling in details. The traumatizing part for students is usually realizing how much they didn’t know about their own bodies.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvn99tq/)
I recently had a very large kidney stone removed by breaking it up into smaller pieces and passing those pieces in urine. A few times when I have ejaculated, these bits of kidney stones come out in the ejaculate long after most debris appears to have passed already in the urine. How is this possible?|(1) Contact your doctor with kidney concerns, I am not an MD (2) Do you have a penis...? (3) Kidney stones come out on their own time and they may still be developing time to time. A kidney stone wouldn’t come from ejaculate, but if you ejaculate with greater force (cum real hard), you might just be pressuring the area. Without urine, this would be even more painful than a standard stone...hence why I ask #2.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvn0vth/)
Why doesn’t she want me anymore?|I will probably need more details on this one. People are attracted to and remain in relationships based on balance of energy and effort.  If you gave me your and her age, I could guess based on averages.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvn94e0/)
how much dick do you get|Like in my personal life? Daily? Weekly? All time? I try to stay busy...so I have contacts all over.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvnbv0a/)

What made yoy start hurting yourself?|I felt numb and wanted to feel something. I was completely devoid of any emotions, and I quickly became addicted to it. I really liked doing it. My routine started to be made to fit the time I spent hurting myself. Eventually, I just kept doing it not because I liked it but because I couldn’t quit it. The fact that I hate my body didn’t help either.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mwujyk/today_i_am_1_month_self_harm_free_for_the_first/gvl79oi/)

My parents did catch me once at the start but they thought I stopped doing it. I got scolded heavily for it. So I really have no one to tell but Reddit. I wish you the very best.

So you start with a primer. A primer helps to make the makeup application look smoother and last longer.
Foundation (it should match your skin tone) helps to even out the complexion. 
Concealer ( few shades lighter than skin tone) helps in brightening the under eyes. A concealer closer to your skin tone would help in concealing blemishes. 
A setting powder to lock all of that in place. 
I guess those are the most confusing and basics of steps.

And I think I heard something about some states requiring them to participate in ""chemical castration"" through medication. 

But when you say ""alienating them from the communities they harm"", do you mean alienating them from children? It just seems like good sense to keep them away from children, like how we don't let violent offenders have guns. If that's not what you meant, then disregard.

I'm sorry you were harmed as a child, you didn't deserve that and it must have been difficult.

So I tell people, be careful with what tools your children have and at what ages. 

Pornography is everywhere. We use sex to sell everything and sex is everywhere. The worst thing you could do is pretend it doesn’t happen...so instead, start relationship, bodies and media literacy conversations early. Teach your son about what he sees and be a little cautious about what he watches and the messages therein. 

Also, be careful with his friends. Boys will watch porn because they get introduced by someone, someone’s older brother. Don’t prevent your son from a social life, but before he goes and sleeps over somewhere, just know that porn is likely on the menu.

From the sentencing commission on the sex offender registry: http://www.ctosj.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sex-Offender-Report-12.1.2017Final-edits.pdf 

To quote: “Research does not support these myths, but there is research to suggest that such policies may ultimately be counterproductive,” 

As for what they deserve: I think the purpose of any institution of society should be to improve it and I reject moralistic notions of what people “deserve” on the grounds that what people often think criminals deserve does not materially improve society as we prioritize retribution over making our society better and reducing the risks of such crimes happening again. There’s also the issue of non-offending pedophiles who can not seek out therapy to help make sure they don’t offend in the first place, but because we have such a kneejerk reaction against them we have legislated that a therapist must on threat of losing their license report any such person to legal authorities whether they’ve committed a crime or not which then gets them put on a sex offender registry anyways which basically makes the social pariahs incapable of being full members of society and alienating them from any possibility of communal identity; this dissuades non-offending pedophiles from seeking out treatment increasing the risk that children do get hurt. 

Our current system of turning them into social pariahs and alienating them from the communities they harm only results in further harm.

[],,bayan963,,,[],,,,text,t2_27pdee6c,False,False,[],"Okay so here's the thing about details, Koran in itself doesn't include details like the 72 virgins thing, it only says that there will be beautiful people of both genders for every person in heaven, that there will be rivers of wine and honey, that people will be wearing fine green fabrics and expensive jewelry of gold and silver, and that they will be at peace with the company of others, they will each have their own extravagant mansions and anything else they desire

The thing about all of this, is that it's meant to appeal to human nature of liking luxury and comfort, especially when it's technically free at that point, the cost has already been paid in this life, so all that humans desire that they were restricted or prohibited from is now allowed hence the wine and beautiful people part 

The details don't matter, what matters is that if you go to heaven you will be at peace, you will be pampered and you will be happy, those for me are the most appealing parts, I don't focus on the details especially the ones that people come up with like the number of virgins or how beautiful they will be or how much alcohol they can drink (here's a side note, the alcohol in heaven doesn't make you drunk or tipsy), those are all perverted ways to think about it in my opinion, it will not be that kind of place, we will be changed in a way where all the bad qualities in our human nature will be removed and only the best of man kind will be there

As for the question of whether Christians can be included, here's the interesting part, all of the messengers, Jesus and Moses included were delivering the same message as Islam, they were sent by the same god only to different people and their books or verses were in different languages that corresponded with the people they were sent to, so in a sense Islam is a succession of their message. 

In Koran it says that those who were faithful, belived in god and god alone, believed in the afterlife and were good people will receive their award, they will get a chance, but the most important part is believing in god as the only god, that Jesus was not his son nor the Holy Spirit anything but his creation as we are

That is the biggest discrepancy between Christianity, Jewdism and Islam, that both Christianity's and Jewdism's books were altered, and it was so before Islam came along because it's mentioned in the Koran several times. The miracle of the Koran is that god vowed to keep it from being altered as it is the last book, so it can be a guidance for anyone seeking god's words
