Second, your experience is quite more widespread than one would think, and media culture presenting sex the way it does isn't helping. For what it's worth, my personal first was very similar in nature (and later on the age scale), so I can very much get you. And yes, it also was anxiety that caused it. Unfortunately, the experience and follow-up anxiety ruined it for me for quite some time, despite my partner being extremely understanding (but potentially evenly insecure.) It took me a long time to get the self-expectation-thoughts out of my brain, and they are for sure total lust-killers and self-fulfilling prophecies.  Usually this established itself as being both horny and hot up to the moment of penetration when things... well, weakened.  
For me, the ""click"" moment was when at one point I decided to just not care and concentrate (for a moment) purely on myself and *not* the partner. Not the typical sex-advice, I know, and not how I practice sex nowadays, but it was an essential thing to break through the self-imposed barrier and gain the necessary self-esteem.  


However, I should also add that this was way later and with a different partner, and what helped me tremendously coming to that point was that the two of us spent quite a few lovely nights with non-penetration sex. You don't necessarily need to ""get it up"" to satisfy your partner. And seeing that I could take care of my partner's needs helped building up self-esteem as well.

I (f19) don't come from a wealthy family, hell, we've been in the lowest tax bracket my entire life. I did struggle in that financial working sense that the original commenter is referring to, but that's not the only way to experience pain. It's a different life experience to have to go through, and although it added a lot of stress that made me capable of handling situations that I wouldn't have had the strength to otherwise, I still felt that feeling of inadequacy, and that I had too much good in my life to be depressed over. I mean, I had my own bed, I had running water, and I had electricity. Who was I to complain, and even worse, why would I even want to take my own life? I realized that depression doesn't impact people based on what they have, or if their struggles are considered bigger or smaller than others. 

I was a gifted child as well, and I understand the pressure of performing in school. My dad would say the same thing about my grades (before the divorce), if I got a 98 he would want to know if they were teaching everything in class, bc if they were, then it should have been a 100. That sense of my identity and worth coming from my academic performance really fucked me up when I realized it, and it made me search for other ways to find self worth. If that is something you're struggling with, I really do recommend helping others. Volunteer work, and just doing nice things, makes me feel good, even when I didnt want shower for a week, I knew I'd have to shower and get out of bed if I want to help. If that's not your thing, or if you haven't tried it before. Give it a try, volunteer at the animal shelter, or a soup kitchen or anywhere where your presence helps others. You'll find a sense of community that Covid has taken away.

I've been putting myself through college starting at 16 (I juggled high school, college, and 2 jobs) and even now that I'm 19, a Junior in Neuroscience and pursuing a medical path, I still get those feelings of inadequacy. I was also rejected from my top colleges, and I now attend a stateside school. My gf broke up with me before this school year started and honestly it fucking sucked. I really loved her. I'm gonna be honest, it's gonna suck for the next 6 months when you think about your ex, but trust me, you'll move on with time. Around that time was when I got heavier into weed, although I smoked here and there since 16, the stress of covid and all the other blocks in my life coming down really made me reliant on it. I noticed that when I stopped, my emotions mellowed out, and my lows weren't quite so low anymore. Unfortunately it's a love-hate relationship and something I still struggle with. At the end of the day, I'm still standing, im still here. I've made attempts on my life in the past, and it's something I could not see myself doing again. I understand where you're coming from.

Although we come from different worlds. We're all just people, and at the end of the day, all we have is each other. I hope you reach out for counseling or therapy. I started about 2 months ago, and having someone to talk to really does help, since I don't have that with the people around me. Depression is treatable, things do get better. Choose to try and be better, even when it fucking sucks. Brush your teeth even if you don't feel like it, take a shower, and start chipping away at the little things in your life.

AMAB (assigned male at birth) and AFAB (assigned female at birth) bodies are actually incredibly similar, more similar than you think, and hormone treatment really makes you realize that! like, for example, in AFAB bodies, fat usually collects in the breasts, butt, thighs, and hips, while in AMAB bodies it collects in the shoulders and stomach. as part of the process, my body fat redistributed to typical AMAB locations, leaving my body much less femininely shaped. even my breasts got smaller. other physical changes that happened were that my jawline got sharper, my muscles got more dense (im not necessarily stronger tho lol), i got WAY more body hair (im talking all over my ass and stomach and around my nipples and some medicore facial hair that i just shave off) and my voice dropped a bit and i have a visible adams apple. however, one of the first changes that occurred that i was never really told, was bottom growth. bottom growth is basically when the clitoris gets bigger, and essentially forms a very small penis. hormone treatment also affected me emotionally, it made me happier, not just because it was gender affirming, but chemically it made me happy. it also gave me a bit worse of a temper and more physically violent when i am angry. it also increased my sex drive DRAMATICALLY, like the change is still noticeable. every week when i take my injection, the next day i am incredibly... in the mood. lol. as for periods, i started with hormone blockers for probably a year before testosterone (which is taken every three months), so i had not had a period for quite some time, and continued not to have one. though im having some weird complications right now im working out with my endocrinologist about my periods because ive been having some break through D:
but! essentially, hormones alone are a huge step in my transition, and were enough to be read as male by strangers. 

typically for transmasculine gender affirming surgeries, surgeons will want you to have been taking testosterone for at least a year, to optimize your body for the change. the surgeries i am planning on are top surgery (masectomy) and a hysterectomy. im all set to go for top surgery because i have been on testosterone long enough, and i have to speak with a surgeon about the hysterectomy to make sure im all set for that. but yeah! those are my planned steps for my transition, but every trans person is different with their own steps. some trans men may keep their uterus, or some may get bottom surgery (phalloplasty), or really any combination or treatment. :))

For the sake of being transparent, we won't wash them unless they've been used, or if our inspector finds a defect/stain that had gotten missed or something out of the ordinary. 

As for covid protocols, we live in the only county in Idaho that still mandates masks, Boise probably does too, but I don't know for sure since I haven't been there in over a year. 

So the masks are still a must, and would be even without the mandate. Currently our breakfast buffet is served as if it were a lunch-lady setup. One chef in the back, and a server up front who builds your tray for you. Although we are shortly going back to the regular buffet we used to serve. They also have a limit in the breakfast room of up to 10 people, not including employees.

Our hot tub and pool are outdoors, and as such don't have many requirements. The hot tub is loosely enforced to have up to 4 people in it at a time, but usually this rule is broken, and the front desk doesn't have much time to worry about that. Pool unrestricted.

I don't know the exact ins-and-outs of how they clean the rooms now, but I know it takes our housekeeping much longer to clean now. We had to change our check in time to 4:00pm. 

We have a bunch of board games in our lobby for our guests to use, which we just got okayed to use again which I'm very excited about, and also just got the okay to serve cookies at our front desk again, so I will likely be gaining a lot of weight soon. Things here are gradually going back to normal.

The most tedious new policy, albeit a good one, is sanitizing each room key. The reason it's tedious it the keys have some paint laden into them and they become very ""dusty"".

Question | Answer | Link
---------|----------|----------|
Can you identify any particular triggers, or do you feel like you were just born this way?  I (27F) have also been depressed my whole life.|I feel like I was born this way, especially considering the circumstances of my birth (asphyxiation)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3p5wo/i_24f_have_been_depressed_my_whole_life_ama/gwr6lpf/)
No question here. Just hope you're doing well! :D|Nope, I’m in the middle of a depressive episode over school because I hate it and it sucks, plus I’m dealing with the physical side effects of a medication I was taking for something else (I’ve stopped it after consulting with my doctor but I’m still feeling the negative side effects of it). Overall I’m doing really bad right now.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3p5wo/i_24f_have_been_depressed_my_whole_life_ama/gwr3nyb/)
Are you on medication? Do you do illicit drugs?|I’m on Trintellix, Effexor, and Abilify for my depression but I’ve been on at least ten different antidepressants throughout the years. I don’t do drugs because I know that they’ll make me much worse.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3p5wo/i_24f_have_been_depressed_my_whole_life_ama/gwr4r8j/)
I too have suffered from depression most of my life, do you have a strong support network?|Not really, just my family, friends, and doctors. I used to have a therapist but I didn’t like her so I stopped seeing her. I’m way too tired right now to go through the trouble of finding a new therapist and going through the intake procedure.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3p5wo/i_24f_have_been_depressed_my_whole_life_ama/gwr3rcs/)
How do ya cope buddy, seems relatable but only half my life|I used to be okay but I guess I didn’t take care of myself well enough while I was feeling fine (I didn’t really have a normal sleep schedule) and I have a lot of schoolwork to do so I’m depressed again. I think the only reason why I’m still alive right now is my many hospitalizations and medical treatments, which only work in the short term but I guess they’re better than nothing.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3p5wo/i_24f_have_been_depressed_my_whole_life_ama/gwr3xmf/)
If you were free to do whatever you want, what do you think would most help you not be depressed?|I wish I could have a fun social life, get married to someone I love, go on vacations with the best food and experiences, and raise a menagerie of animals but nobody’s got money for endless fun|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3p5wo/i_24f_have_been_depressed_my_whole_life_ama/gwr67an/)
Your whole life? Even when you were a child?|Yup. When I was a child I threw tantrums a lot and I was upset more than normal kids were when things didn’t go my way.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3p5wo/i_24f_have_been_depressed_my_whole_life_ama/gwr6fzx/)
Are you okay?|Nope, I’m in a depressive episode right now. I made this AMA partially to vent.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3p5wo/i_24f_have_been_depressed_my_whole_life_ama/gwr7zob/)
Were you diagnosed or you diagnosed yourself|I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder at age 16.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3p5wo/i_24f_have_been_depressed_my_whole_life_ama/gwrv55s/)
Have you explored microdosing?|No, I haven’t.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3p5wo/i_24f_have_been_depressed_my_whole_life_ama/gwrvomo/)
Have you seen the studies being done about micro dosing shrooms and/or them being used for depression? I don’t believe shrooms are for everyone, but if taken responsibly/in the right setting can be miraculous. I had one night that wiped my depression off the map. I hope you’re able to achieve that same feeling of relief I had, having had my depression and anxiety wiped away.|I have not heard about shrooms being used to treat depression and I worry that they would do more harm than good because I tend to have many adverse reactions to medications.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3p5wo/i_24f_have_been_depressed_my_whole_life_ama/gwsfmeq/)

One time, when I was in the 8th or 9th grade, it was snowy and iced over outside. I had just gotten home from school, and realized that my key wasn't with me. I was locked outside in the freezing cold, with neither of my parents home, and no cell phone. I walked to my next door neighbor's house to ask if I could use their house phone to call my parents and the wife (whose name I *still* do not know, over a decade later) answered the door by just barely cracking it open. When I explained my predicament, she--I kid you not--refused to let me inside, and closed the door in my face. Needless to say, when I shared this story with my mom, she was ready to exchange a few...not-so-nice words with their household.

NATO countries have increased from 1.47% of GDP in 2013 to 1.78% in 2020 on average. Assuming the trend continues that will put them at 1.96% by the 2024 goal. 

Just to put this in perspective (excluding US spending) the global average on defense is 1.81%. With $307.5 billion in spending, they dwarf China ($261.0 billion) and Russia ($65.1 billion). Combined with nuclear weapons, it's hard to imagine NATO being attacked even without US involvement.

&gt;Americans can’t benefit from their own taxpayers dollars because their country is spending that money to protect other countries.

Again, as I've shown the US is plenty wealthy enough to cover both military spending--which we should note the US spends more because we believe it benefits **us**--and other social programs. It should also be noted that even if the US were to decrease military spending to global averages it would barely cover 10% of our healthcare spending per year.

Question | Answer | Link
---------|----------|----------|
You can *smell* horny people?|That's correct, and depending on the person it can be a very arousing and intoxicating scent, or nothing at all. This would have been nice if I couldn't smell it on myself aswell...|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwr5609/)
Please let us know what your doctor says when you see him soon! I hope things will get better for you|I'll keep y'all posted, though I fear there's not too much that can be done|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwr9ny9/)
How does this affect you as a member of society?|Honestly it affects me a lot, as all my functions one way or another is fueled by this. Socializing, doing errands, going out at all really, somehow, subconsciously I'm tricked into thinking that sex is a potential reward for literally all my actions.  Combined with a hypersensitive nose, I can smell hormones; As in, I can smell when people are horny, haven't gotten laid in a while, heck I've told my best friends (a couple) when hanging out at my place ""You're free to use my bedroom, I don't care"" minutes before they realize themselves they're moody. This one is a bit double sided because it has guided me a couple times, but most of the time it's just annoying and directly intoxicating and makes me go nuts.  Though I have a couple friends who understand my issues, it's VERY hard for me to create and maintain bonds with people because of this, because at one point or another I start to sexualize them.  Long story short, I spend 95% of my time locked up in my apartment living on welfare, because I can get so aggressively horny I can virtually feel myself crawl out of my own skin (satyroMANIA), it terrifies me so I reduce human contact as much as possible, so I'd say I'm not even a member of society at this point.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwqv4hq/)
Has this affected your willingness to have sex? Like do you try to limit yourself from indulging for any reason? Or do you just use tinder or find someone some other way?  Also has this affected your sexuality/gender preferende at all?|\&gt; Has this affected your willingness to have sex? Like do you try to limit yourself from indulging for any reason? Or do you just use tinder or find someone some other way? Oh man if it were up to me I'd be having sex 24/7, but I'm banned from Tinder for having a shirtless photo on my profile (I'm a guy) and well I'm autistic as shit, no one wants me.  \&gt; Also has this affected your sexuality/gender preferende at all? Actually yeah it has, as a young teenager I was completely straight, and were only interested in girls my age. Now I'm a open-minded pansexual, I'm into everyone and everything, as long it can give consent it's good enough for me.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwra9m2/)
So does this mean you are too horny to function?   Do you think gunpowder is angry sand?  Can you control your horniness if you want?|\&gt; So does this mean you are too horny to function? At times, I get so horny that I fear myself and what I can accomplish, sometimes it literally affects my entire body to the point where I'm just worming and wiggling around wanting it to stop.  \&gt; Do you think gunpowder is angry sand? No, it's sand but with a short fuse.  \&gt; Can you control your horniness if you want? As in ""channeling it into something creative""? Fuck no. I smoke a crapload of weed though and that helps a little bit|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwr4s7i/)
At first i thought "" damn this dude has got the cheat codes, should be happy"" but after reading more, it seems like a curse .  In a perfect world you could just wander around  seeking out the horny people and fuck them all, but the reality is a lot different|Yeah man, the word ""Curse"" is exactly the word I'd use, this is pain.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwrgf99/)
Are you male or female?|Satyromania is the male version of Nymphomania, so yeah I'm a guy|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwr23sm/)
Do you have issue forming proper romantic relationships?|I don't do romance, for a lot of different reasons, though this is one of them|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwr4j02/)
Have you ever had sex with a nymphomaniac? I'm just imagining two people just constantly banging to either assert dominance or to see which one will quit first.|Hehe, back when my ex and I lived together, it was basically non-stop fucking all the time with the exception of the times when I wrecked her so badly she needed days to recover. Then there were days when I was knocked out, that motherfucker spiked my milkshake with viagra. Guys think they want a lot of sex until they meet a woman who wants a lot of sex.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwrnaj3/)
What’s the worst instance where your disorder affected your life?|The fact that I barely have any interests aside from sex, nothing else in live matters or motivates me. I'm starting to lose interest in all my other hobbies, like gaming, programing, editing, socializing, it's plain depressing to be honest.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwr5mkn/)
How old were you wen you first started being sexually active (with yourself or a partner)/is it true that satyromanicism starts at a very young age?|I've been jerking off since before I started school mate, 'cording to my family I've been humping shit since even before that, yeah that's true.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwreeys/)
How do you cope with it?|I jerk off, a lot, I smoke a crapload of weed, and I jerk off some more|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwrnlli/)
Pornhub or xvideos|I've prolly watched out all them sites bro|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwromc3/)

Not true, and that's an outright stupid take. The US spends more on healthcare than any other country on Earth (both in absolute numbers and in relative numbers), so your logic doesn't hold on (if the problem is that ""the US doesn't have money for healthcare"", how is the US spending the most money on healthcare?). The problem has nothing to do with what the US spends on other countries protection, it has to do with your parties being little bitches to companies. You could regulate the market and have an efficient and free healthcare system, you just choose not to. And that ""you"" includes you. You are here on reddit convincing yourself that free healthcare is impossible because you've been told not to want that.

On the topic of the ""US protecting other countries"", that's bullshit. In the XXI century, no country will go to war with European countries, not even Russia. The US spends egregious amounts of money on the military because they want to funnel money to the war industry, and then cover it up pretending it's ""to protect Europe"". Denmark needs no protection from daddy US and so, the money the US spends on defending Denmark is exactly $0. The money the US spends for other reasons that it calls ""defending Denmark"", that's another issue.

The energy amplifier event also helps to boost the use od shield characters on the twisted realm which i really appreciates it as big C6 noelle and zhongli mains myself.

But one thing thats really pisses me off other the the heralds in the new spiral abyss is that mihoyo purposefully holds out on the lore of the main story on the new zhongli quest.

Not only that it gave me a false hope which is the last thing that i need when im pretty disappointed with archon story quest when we met our lost sibling way too soon.

The idea of excuses to holding out the lore about what happens to khaen'riah really messes the story for me... As a whale, i don't mind spending a huge amount of money into this game because i was really invested with the character's story and their gameplay. 

However, it almost felt like the whole time i was grinding and spending was kinda pointless, because i felt i kinda waste my money and time for a game with bad story.

Fortunately, noelle's second hang out quest and this new event kinda gives more reason to play, at least until the chasm is released on 1.6
Then i might reconsider whether i should continue playing the game or not...

We chose to live here because the hotel has a manager's apartment, which became available as our previous manager (my mom's old boss) found a new home nearby. My mom was hired as an assistant manager, and our rent was extremely high since it's such an expensive area and we are far from rich. So we took the manager's apartment and we've lived there since.

I already got him since his 1.1 first release as my first limited 5 star characters before jean and diluc in the standard banner. 

Loved him all the away because im a shield hero fan lol

&gt;Do you also harbor a grudge towards Jean because you got her instead of Zhongli, what about Keqing?

I only bear grudge against jean in terms of lore, im a big noelle and ironically enough despite jean being her role model she's the sole reason why noelle have yet to join the knights.

She's an acting grandmaster yet all she do is finding missing cats and doing random errands yet she hasn't evaluate a potential great candidate like noelle properly, talk about poor management skill and overworked.

Overall in terms of gameplay, she and keqing is a bit over hype since kaeya actually does more damage than them as a sword users by far in terms of normal attack and E when they're on the same level.

And as for keqing, she is actually fine. 
She has a fun gameplay, but not necessarily as OP and statisfying as diluc and xiao though 
I just hope she wasn't my 50/50 when im pulling for ganyu though

&gt;Why can't I get Zhongli?

This is actually complicated question, how much is your pull from your last 5 star in the limited character right now?
Your chance of getting a 5 star is between 75-90th pull from your last 5 star, a good rule of thumb that i usually do is to do a single pull after my 70th pull.
I got xiao and childe thanks to this trick

And if you fail 50/50 your next 5 star will be guaranteed be the 5 star in the banner. 

&gt;Also why pay for stuff, the game is free? My sister does these thing called welkin moon or something, where she pays for some monthly things, but I don't understand why.

I have good job with decent pay, at first i was so impressed by the game that buy the starter packs and the welkins out of appreciation and to enjoy the game by Pay to win. 

 i was planning to make every characters in my account to be the best by maxing their stats out but turns out the resources necessary to build them up requires a bit of money.

Not to mention, you'll need welkins to actually be able to afford intertwined fate per day, else the primogems in this game would be pretty scarce.
Especially when you're already explore everything on the map till 100%

And before i knew it, i have already spend 300 canadian dollars over the course of 6 month by buying welkins, battle pass monthly and along with the top ups from 7 to 70 dollars binds.",,,1620048601,{},gws44mr,True,t3_n3s92z,False,False,t1_gwrwwxa,/r/AMA/comments/n3s92z/im_a_genshin_impact_player_who_played_the_game/gws44mr/,1620077501,2,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],,

I'm going to suggest seeking help there. I've been doing NA myself, and I'm coming up on 6 years clean. Before I started going to meetings, anytime I tried to quit cold turkey it was so utterly miserable that I fell back into using. Even if you're not using now, sounds like your circumstances are enforcing that; it won't last.

There are some parts of it I'm not thrilled with (the religious-lite philosophies mostly), but the loving , supportive environment of the fellowship and the deep introspection and healing driven by the 12 step process has had a tremendous impact on me.

I bring this up because for me, addiction drove my depression. It wasn't just the impact of the chemicals on my brain, even during periods where I stayed clean-ish on my own, my ability to just do life was diminished. My coping skills were just getting high, my every day life was a roller coaster of messed up emotions, which always drove me back to drugs.

When I finally got clean for real and was going to meetings, early on I was convinced I needed anti depressants. However, after a while I just got drastically better, simply because I was working on healing and living a better life, with the love and support of others.

NA is not the only option. There are 12 step Whatever Anonymous groups for anything and everything under the sun. There is Refuge Recovery (Buddhism), SMART recovery (CBT), and many others. My point is working on your addiction can have tremendous benefits.

In time, you'll see that this is just your fantasy life, and that it's ok. 

It sounds like you're just sexually attracted to horse genitals, not emotionally/romantically attracted to horses. If you have sexual or romantic feelings toward people, which it sounds like you do, then this sexual interest will always remain just a fantasy while you live your life -- dating, getting married and having a family if that's what you want.

They said they liked my work but couldn't hire me until I had a degree but they had a bureau in the city I was studying in and offered a freelance position. Worked that job while I was in college and got a dual major in broadcasting and foreign languages. That full time job never came but one day after college someone from CNN called asking if I was interested in freelancing for them and had heard my name through other people on TV. I gladly accepted. The job was pretty much the same, but the buttons were in different places. Over all glad I did it while I was young and ambitious

---------|----------|----------|
what is DID ?|DID is a disorder characterized by the presence of two or more distinct personality states.  Dissociative identity disorder, previously called multiple personality disorder, is usually a reaction to trauma as a way to help a person avoid bad memories. Dissociative identity disorder is characterized by the presence of two or more distinct personality identities. Each alter has a unique name, personal history, and characteristics.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwoxdiw/)
What is a DID system? I've heard of the condition but not a system?|A system is what happens when a person has DID. The personality doesn't fully integrate so it becomes many personalities. The many personalities are called a system. Does this make sense?|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwoxi1c/)
When did you first realize you were in a system?|Note I am a newer alter so I asked the core.  She said that she knew that something was different for years but didn't know what it was. Our parents made us go to therapy after some things hadn't been going well. Everest is an alter who is fascinated by psychology and he came across DID when reading a textbook, and he asked our therapist about it. That was when we realized that we are a system.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gworp20/)
How many is there currently in your system?  Is your current host the original host?  Has anyone in the system experienced integration yet? If so, are you able to tell me about that experience?|There are 16 that we know of,  The current host is not the original host,  None of us have integrated nor do we want to.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwoulaj/)
Who is the youngest|We don't say any of our littles names. The youngest little is 3-4 years old. That is all I will say.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwotsqd/)
What would you say is the most difficult aspect of having DID|Happy cake day.  The most difficult part of DID I would say, is not being able to spend as much time as I would like doing things I like.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwp0bjc/)
Do the alters have different IQs? Like if one studies for an exam, and a switch happens during the exam, what happens? (I’m not sure if it’s called a switch, sorry if it’s not the right word)|Switch is the correct word. I wouldn't say we have different IQs necessarily, however when you have a 3 yo and a 20+ yo in the same head, things are different. My system has decided that certain alters are responsible for different classes. I (Elliot) am responsible for math, science, and STEAM. Everest is responsible for english, history, and art. Ghost is responsible for all other classes. This helps prevent us from switching during exams, if we do switch we have accommodations to help us.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwp4dc9/)
I really don’t mean to be rude but is each personality sort of like a different person? Are each of you aware of this?|Each alter is a different person. We are all aware that there are other alters, most (all but 2) are aware that we have DID.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwp5o4l/)
Is there a hobby or interest that one alter is passionate about that the others aren’t into at all?|I (Everest) play trumpet, the others don't play and don't like to play. We have a horse and compete with it and only a few of us ride/ take care of him.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwpi42e/)
How do you decide who to tell about your DID and who to not tell?|Every alter is different. We dont generally tell people unless we will be working closely with them for an extended period of time.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwqkrk3/)
What does it feel like when you switch and are no longer the host?  Where do you go and what do you see?  I’m sorry if that sounds ignorant, I’m just not sure how else to word it.|It isnt ignorant, it sounds like it is coming from a place of genuine curiosity and we are willing to answer any question if it is from a place of genuine curiosity. Every switch is different, some are extremely rapid and you wont notice, and some take minutes. We go to the headspace. It is a castle with different areas, alters are limited on where we are allowed to go. As the host I am only allowed on my corridor. There are other alters rooms, and those alters I have good communication with. If I switch with Mike I will have hime answer.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwql1vg/)
Is there a “main” personality? Are you the “main” personality?|The ""main"" personality is called the host. The host is the person that fronts most. I (Everest) am a co-host and a protector.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwqmauj/)
How do you feel the media illustrates DID and do you feel it is realistic (like the movie Split)?|We hate it. We haven't watched Split, nor do we want to. From what I have heard, they portray systems as serial killers or narcissistic, and we would never do that. Because of our trauma and genders/sexualitys we are more likely to fall pretedor to both of these.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwqmhix/)

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&amp;c.**, **&amp;c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

(We currently don’t have the best of the best when it comes to a GM) Me being a front desk agent and barely having any clean rooms to give our reservations, I decided to go out and clean a few rooms myself. I may had spent about an hour on one room but I would periodically go check the front office to make sure no one was waiting for me (I should also mention that I work alone on the second shift). 

During this time I had encounters with two angry people, one angry because she needed a two bed room but we only had a 1 bed available after she complained about her initial room because it wasn’t a smoking, and the other guy angry because I needed to put pillowcases on his pillows before checking him in to save him some time from coming back and complaining. 

Well after doing a really shitty job on making the beds, I went back to the front to check if anyone was there. Had a guy in the lobby waiting to get inside since the door was locked. I went inside and let him in along with another guest and did my best to explain the situation. Apparently the guy had been waiting there for an hour but I quickly called him on the bullshit since I’d just been at the desk not even 15 minutes ago.

So he decided me to get angry with me once I tell him we had no rooms available tonight. Usually that’s the part where guests feel like for some reason, they have to explain their plight and how much of an inconvenience you are because of their poor planning, which I understand in some cases but the guy was just a complete asshole about it. After he finished his rant and walks out of the door, I looked at the other guy and uttered “anyway, what can I do for you?”

Of course this guy haaad to be within earshot of this, and comes back inside, puffs up his chest and starts saying “what’d you say? Did you say anyways? I bet you won’t come from behind the counter and say it to my face. Matter fact, you go ahead and do that and I got something waiting for you in the trunk.”

Why are you suicidal?|I’ve had passive suicidal ideation for a couple months now mostly just stemming from the depression. When my girlfriend of 4 years ended things that took a step up just out of feeling worthless and not good enough.  The tipping point was when my mom started to say some pretty horrible things to me because I’m “sad all the time and won’t snap out of it”.

Do you think you're striving for perfection? When you don't reach that bar there is no satisfaction?|Always have needed perfection from myself. And recently due to the way I’ve been feeling I can’t even focus on the easy things and it drives me crazy and makes me feel like complete shit|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3gmnj/im_privileged_grew_up_rich_was_gifted_in_school/gwqvbnj/)
Fellow depressed &amp; anxious person but I have never had any suicidal thoughts or feelings for it. Because of that I’m pretty good to talk to whenever you have those feelings, if you ever need someone to talk to my pm’s are open.  You are worth living for  - another struggling internet stranger|That means a lot, thank you for the support|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3gmnj/im_privileged_grew_up_rich_was_gifted_in_school/gwqwwaa/)

Instead of forbidding internet and social media,  young kids should not be left alone with it until they grow into it and demonstrate they can be responsible with it.
I compare it with streets and traffic.  No one would suggest to keep kids locked up until they are of age. Neither does one just send them out on a busy street alone to find their own way to the playground. 
Instead one starts by holding hand and quiet roads until they learn. One explains the dangers and safety rules slowly and in children terms as they grow up. And at a certain time one trusts them, allows them making small mistakes while still keeping an eye on them for a while. 

Same goes with internet and social media. Hand a mobile or browser to the five year old and then leave the room for an hour? Hell no! But sitting with me, reading writing on social media and explaining things? Yes.

There is - and has to be - a middle ground between keeping  internet away from kids and just handing it to them without limits and supervision. 

And while the dangers of the net do no doubt exist,  luckily they are usually not immediate and irreversible.  Might your 10year old learn about some topics a bit earlier than you anticipated? Yes. Is that bad? Only if left alone with it. It's up to the adults to teach .both about the things encountered but also that they should ask/talk about those things with you.

The main difference between streets and internet in this comparison is, that a lot of adults themselves are not really comfortable and competent.",,,1620023709,{},gwr60bg,False,t3_n3n9t4,False,True,t3_n3n9t4,/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwr60bg/,1620056982,1,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],,

---------|----------|----------|
As many creepy and weird calls you get throughout the day, has anyone on the phone at your job actually managed to turn you on?|I’ve been doing this for 6 years and have only ever actually gotten off with my caller maybe 4-5 times. It’s a very rare occurrence. It has to be a perfect storm. I have to be in the mood, the caller has to want to discuss things I’m into, have a sexy voice as well as they gotta be just as vocal with me as I am with them. It’s super rare but it has happened.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwoqgjl/)
What’s the weirdest thing someone asked of you?|Toss up between a guy who had a fetish for sneezing and wanted to hear me sneeze. Naturally, I can’t sneeze on command so I did everything I could. Finally when nothing seemed to work, he suggested using black pepper. I was blowing pepper of out my nose for like 3 days.  Or the guy who had probably the most sickening fetish I’ve ever encountered. We wanted to roleplay a scene where I would mutilate his penis. He wanted me to describe the scene in vivid detail. I was so uncomfortable and felt sick, I didn’t care if it was money, I just hung up.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwnye81/)
Is it a satisfying job???|Absolutely. I work from home, in my Pj’s. I can do other things in between calls, I work as little or as much as I want to, and make a solid pay, even on slow days.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwnzj5u/)
How much do you make a day?|On the low end about $150-200. On the high end $500. Depends on call length, daily traffic, if goodies sell, if I receive tips, and how active my chat is that day.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwo13oo/)
Do you do erotic like ASMR?|I haven’t had a request for that, at least not yet. I’m also not certain my phone’s mic would be good enough quality to be considered ASMR. However if I did pre-recordings using my computer’s headset, I could totally get away with it. It would just have to be sold as recording as oppose to being done live over a phone call because I use my phone for work, not my computer.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwo14wg/)
Which platform?|Niteflirt|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwo9arw/)
What’s your favourite thing to be asked do?|I love when I’m told specifically to not be fake. I’m serious. Most girls on my platform have this persona built, and when I get a caller who wants to see more of who I really am, I can drop the whole nympho brat persona and just be me. I talk to them like a friend, and we build a genuine bond. That’s how you turn callers into repeated clients.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwogrfu/)
How did you get started doing this? How do you keep yourself safe? Do you have a separate phone to handle calls? Can you do it anonymously?|I got started in 2014, shortly after losing my dad. When I was let go with a bunch of other part timers from my part time job, I hit a major depression. This caused me to look for other avenues and stumbled across a forum about the various adult industries, phone sex included. So i did my researched, picked a platform and never looked back.  Keeping myself safe is easy. Any images on my profile do not reveal my face, and show zero identifiable markings. If clients ask where I’m from, I’ll be honest and say the country I live in but nothing more. I never share personal information such as my last name, hometown, email, phone number etc.  I use my personal phone for calls because my company acts as a middle man. When I receive a call, I just see the company’s number. Just the same, my caller will only see my extension.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwohyvi/)
How does one get started !?|Do your research. Find a playform that you’re happy with. I liked my platform, Niteflirt because they’ve been around the longest, they have the most amount of traffic and highest payout.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwoj73x/)
What is the salary or wage like as an operator?  What are your career plans?|I set my own price point. I charge a standard rate for phone at $1.99/min. I keep $1.26USD of that. If I put in the work, and with my experience, I can make 5 figures monthly, but my average is $4-6k monthly.  As for career plans, I’m still figuring that out right now. I’d like to get into social work eventually.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwpdgob/)
On NiteFlirt, some girls care about the rules and some will talk about whatever. Can NiteFlirt really know who ""breaks the rules"" about off limit topics? Do they record the calls?|I actually don’t know about that. I know girls can get in a lot of shit if they post about such topics on their listings but idk if they can get in trouble if it’s spoken about on the phone. Sorry :(|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwqd5zv/)
Buy gme ?  And you can do whatever you want.  r/superstonk|Huh?|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwqflm7/)
What is your sex or gender? Do you give out your name to anyone? Have you ever tried to meet up with someone through the service? And finally, are males on the service or is it just women?|I’m a female and identify as female.  I do use my real first name to avoid potential confusion when giving a fake name, but I don’t give out my middle or last name.  I have not and will not ever meet up with someone, that’s just against my personal comfort level, and of course for my safety.  Yes males are on the platform too, however it is dominated by females. There is money in it for men though I’m not sure how lucrative it would be, and I’m fairly certain most of your callers would be other men.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwqmmx2/)
Is there a market for men to do this? I'm hetero but I assume it would likely be gay men calling if anyone wanted to talk to men. Second question do you ever find yourself getting into it|Yes there is a market for men, though I’m not sure how big that market is. I also suspect you’re right, you MIGHT get a female call or two on the occasion, but I think a big majority of your clients would be other men.  And I have gotten into it. I’ve done this for 6 years and have gotten off with a caller maybe 4-5 times. It has to be a perfect storm. I gotta already be in the mood, he’s gotta sound hot, be into all the same things I am and be just as vocal with me as I can be with him. However that is a SUPER RARE occurrence.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwqvddz/)

---------|----------|----------|
I think schools should be required to do social media awareness seminars/classes and courses. Not just to address the potential for addiction - but to recognize the signs of grooming; where to report it or bullying etc; What's appropriate content to share online or not; the risk of hacking/online scams and many more related concerns. This is of paramount importance. We cannot prevent anyone from gaining access to the internet and social media. However, we can mitigate some of the harm it has the potential to do.   This is the age of technology and its irresponsible not to teach kids how to engage it. We don't need the kids to learn baking skills. They have YouTube for that.|This comment made me sad. And I don’t mean that to offend you it’s just indicative of where we are.  “We don’t need the kids to learn baking skills. They have YouTube for that”. You don’t think we, as a society and as people, lose something when our kids turn to internet strangers for help? YOU should be teaching your kid baking skills, not having them go watch YouTube videos on it for goodness sake|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwqwrp3/)
Great. Who enforces it, how do they enforce it, and how is the enforcement funded?|No clue. I’m sure every common sense regulation that we now take for granted began with a chorus of “how do we do that though?”.  Maybe it’ll come in the form of all mobile devices having blocks on social media and you having to remove the child block with credit card info to prove, at the minimum, that you have a credit card.  Maybe when you buy your phones, it comes with some sort of software block you have to have removed there in the store by an employee who verifies you’re over 18.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwqv3t9/)
Would you feel differently if the school system started teaching social media? I personally think they should and very early on.|I dunno.  Social media is addictive. I’m not sure to what extent you can teach around that. Like would it be a fair trade off to legalise the sale of cigarettes to kids if we taught them about tobacco and addiction? I don’t think most people would accept that trade off.  Maybe you’d have leniency after 16 or something.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwqwmsc/)
You seem like you are only focusing on the negative aspects of social media. Wouldn't you say that minors could easily find people who have similar interests to them on social media? It could be a good way for certain minors to make friends, especially if they are considered ""strange"" by their classmates at school.  Also, how can this ban be enforced?|I think the negative outweighs the positive, and to your example I think any real world relationship is infinitely better than one formed online. I’d much rather my kids have sleepovers than stay up at the computer or on their phones (not that I’d let a kid under a certain age even have a phone)  Regulated? No idea. But we manage to have laws against the sale of alcohol, tobacco and porn to minors.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwquqwn/)
Social media has issues but it also provides a teenager very good exposure to the world and information about a lot of things. A lot of the general knowledge I have is through the internet, whether it is tv shows or social media. Now teenage years are a huge part of character development and knowing different things can certainly help. Thoughts on this?|TV shows has nothing to do with social media. I’m not suggesting we ban the internet for kids, just social media. They still get their Netflix, Disney+, maybe even YouTube.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwr06o5/)
One hundred 💯 percent agree how is this even a question|Hey, you coulda been even more confused and thought I meant miners not minors|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwqz2vt/)
It depends on person more than age. Restricting social networking should not happen because children already use it. It is a way to remind everyone they are there. If it is restricted, our children/teens will do worse things. It is not a simple solution. It depends on what they are leaning towards.|I honestly don’t think they’d do worse things. A lot of the horror stories you see/read about are kids getting killed or injured doing internet trend challenges they saw on TikTok or wherever.  At least getting them off social media will keep them grounded in the community rather that talking to people all over being exposed to god knows who.  If the community is a risk (which obviously people around you always pose a risk) I don’t see the logic in widening the pool of people who might pose a risk to your kid from the population of your town to the whole world.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwqxb6f/)
What is your favorite cut of steak|Sirloin probably. I’m a well done man too.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwqxjjv/)
r/phonesarebad|I don’t have a problem with phones|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwqzkxs/)
How do you plan on enforcing this?|Pre-install mobile devices with social media blocking software like a security tag on a bottle of alcohol. Prove to the store that you’re an adult and they remove the software. If you’re a kid, you get stuck with the software.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwqzswe/)
Of all the social media platforms, in your mind what are the worst?  Top 2 or 3 worst for minors?|Twitter I think is the worst offender just because there’s no effective moderation on it such that people have been involved in lengthy lawsuits trying to force twitter to remove sexual content of minors and twitter resisted saying they aren’t responsible for it.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwr025c/)
How about make a law where teenagers can fuck each-other and make it normal so that grooming doesn't happen. For real if laws were based on realistic standards such as the fact it takes 5000 years to evolve and you don't magically change the age at which humans are  to reproduce. Humans are ready to go at 16. So let the teenagers fuck so that sex crimes don't....happen. Bruh. The media ain't the problem it's the laws man.|Uhh what? You seem very keen to be allowed to screw minors dude|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwqys3f/)
If you really care that much just block social media on your Wi-Fi holy fuck it's not that hard.|It’s not about me on social media it’s about raising generations of depressed, vulnerable and neurotic people who have 5 minute attention spans and spend family gatherings glued to a screen.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwqxwc4/)

Due to appearing ""mild"" *sighs* people don't accommodate or change around me at all, which is nice to not be looked down on, however you could very easily hep me and accommodate me where needed whilst not looking down on me! It feels invalidating and makes me gaslight myself about whether I'm just stupid or mean or wrong in trying times.
On the flipside, I know people get treated poorly and like they're stupid once they disclose it, all I can say is like, have common sense and empathy and...don't?
If I can't verbalise a reply, trust that I understand what I'm being told regardless, if I'm slow to get it, it's because my processing speeds a little lagged, not that the contents too hard etc. This will vary again amongst individuals.
Id say it's most important to not just brush off the info of being told your friend or whoever it is is autistic, and to ask them if there's anything they ever struggle with they may need accommodations or understanding from you with. Mainly understanding. Basically just when they do something like struggle in conflict, stim, go non vocal, argue one logical point and ignore emotions and get stuck on it, have the empathy to respond like, ah, that's due to them being autistic, they're not trying to be rude or mean or lazy or unempathetic, address it, move forward with kindness.

If you want me to do something, give me logical reasoning, it's hard for my brain to change and do all the work for something so I look for fair reason to exhaust myself, and a fair reason for most of us will never be 'because that's the way it is', 'because I said so', 'respect your teachers' etc.
I would always respect my teachers because in general they were lovely people trying their hardest and their care was clear, if I didn't see this effort and respect for me I wouldn't comply with what they asked of me if it was something I didn't want to do already. Understand this is an actual thing, and it's not defiance without cause. I can't be bothered to go into the neurological reasoning for it at the moment but basically our neurones struggle to make new paths and destroy old ones, if you request a new path to be made expect resistance unless you provide adequate reason for that path to be created.
I remember fighting with my family when i went to England at 10 and said I'd refuse to bow to the queen outside of Buckingham palace lol, because also we see everybody the same, in that example i like to use, all of the reasons I should have viewed her as authority were social constructs, I don't understand or care for them. Often I understand the social construct, but I just don't care or agree. Be accepting and expect this, also I'm not the biggest fan of the term special.needs. disability isn't a dirty word, we aren't X men lol, I have no special abilities like time travel and I have no special needs either, rather normal needs, but more of them and more help with regular tasks, nothing special about it at all. As I also work in disability with people with all disabilities they seem to hold the same view from what I've asked and seen so far, obviously this will differ.

Viewing your life as ruined will have a profoundly negative impact on your life.  I urge you to try to change this for your children's sake and equally important, for your sake.   
 To give you a counter to this, I was so affected by my mother's experience, I waited until 44 to be a parent.  I very much wish I had done it much earlier (mind you not in my teens). 

You're going to come across some tough choices.  My advice as a now-grown son of a teenage mother, it will be hard, but all decisions center around the children. What I mean by this is best illustrated in a real-life example:   
My mother had opportunities to make life better for her and us, but the short-term sacrifice was too much for the long-term gain.  She began a degree in accounting in her late 20s with the help of my grandparents.  But balancing a part-time job and school with kids became too much after 2 years.   She went back to working 2 full-time jobs where we were left to raise ourselves.  As a result, by the time my sister was in middle school, she was a drunk staying out till 5 AM most nights eventually dropping out of school.  I often think if my mother had just toughed it out 2 more years, she would have found stable work and been around to help guide and even discipline my sister.  We both suffered emotional development problems (serious anger and resentment issues) which I overcame in my 30s, but my sister still deals with to this day.   


I don't know what choices will be before you, but try to remain principled, and focused. It will be hard and I wish you the best.",,,1620007011,{},gwqhges,False,t3_n3kvdm,False,True,t1_gwqfxpi,/r/AMA/comments/n3kvdm/im_17_and_i_have_two_kids_ama/gwqhges/,1620041279,3,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],,

I'm on the lower end of that scale, but my place of work is one of the highest paying for the state I live in.. if that makes any sense.

**Is it worth the stress?:** For some people? No. Maybe this will change, but right now I find the job to be really rewarding and I think my temperament suits this type of high stress environment. I think I've done a pretty good job of keeping my work life and my personal life separate; it's important not to get too attached to the people in your calls, know when you've done everything that you can, and to not focus on what you ""could've"" done.

**Is there schooling involved?:** I took a two week course that cost less than $1,000.

**If someone says ""I heard gunshots outside""?:** You ask where they're located, preferably an exact address or at the very least a street name if the caller isn't at a set location. We can also see a 9-1-1 callers general location, but exact is best. If you have a partner (another dispatcher in the room), you can tell them to dispatch to that address for the sound of gunshots, or you can tell the caller to hold on while you dispatch over the radio yourself.

Sorry my arabic isn't very good. Just wanted to say a few things: first, I appreciate your opened and vulnerability. I can imagine it's hard to grow under the shadow of such a big wealthy tree.
But you should know that if you and I ever met, I would not judge you for how much money you have, how much you've made and how much you can call your own. It means nothing to me. Making money is mostly a dead end game (zero sum game) In my mind. It's all about what you do with it that can make a big difference in the world. You can save thousands of lives or destroy thousands of lives.and no one would praise you or condemn you for it. It's in your heart, inshallah you will stay true to your heart.

I tend to work on web applications, finding bugs, and there are so many vulnerability's. The most common I have seen is simple misconfigurations that allow a malicious website to send off requests to a website with the users session where he is logged in. This could mean that a hacker could lure you to a website and if you do an action (click on a button or something like that) it could send requests to fetch your user data or change some settings. It's called a CORS misconfiguration!

 **What is the most access you've ever managed to get?** 

I've managed to get root / system access to many machines / servers before, this would give me access to write, read and delete any file on the system. 

 **Have you ever had anyone argue against your findings?** 

Yes, I once found what I believed to be an open redirect vulnerability on facebook (an open redirect is when you can provide a crafted URL from a trusted domain which sends you to another malicious page, it can be used in phising attacks to give the victim a false sense of security, the link would start with [www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com) and redirect to a malicious website. I reported it and they came back with some BS that it was something else and only I would be able to get it to work if not it would send an error message, I explained that Im a bug hunter and it is indeed by definition a open redirect and that I clearly state in my Proof of concept that that was not the case and I explained and proved it not to be the case.

I've read some philosophy that I know are true, and some that I didn't agree with because like I said again some things are obvious but they don't speak to my heart. They speak to my head. I can debate them until I've worn the other person out but it's with my head I reason then out. But when I can believe with my heart, it just become a part of me. 


&gt;I didn't need the bible to know that hurting (or killing) others is bad. Philosophers can come to the same conclusion with no need of religion. (Do you know Kant's Categorical_imperative just as an example?)

Anyone can come to the conclusion with no need of religion. It's called an intuitive knowledge of what's right and wrong.

Romans 2 NIRV:
14 Gentiles do not have the law. Sometimes they just naturally do what the law requires. They are a law for themselves. This is true even though they don’t have the law. 

15 They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts. The way their minds judge them proves this fact. Sometimes their thoughts find them guilty. At other times their thoughts find them not guilty. 

Gentiles, in Bible lingo are all the nations who aren't Jewish and so weren't bound by the Law given by God through Moses. 

As for the Categorical Imperative, I believe anyone can do the right rational thing if they're being sensible, thoughtful and levelheaded. So it's not as useful to me as I imagine it may be to you. I do see online that it is used as an argument against the Golden Rule (which is found in religions). I honestly didn't know that many religions had the Golden Rule of Do unto others as you would have them do to you. 

So here's what I see on this web link https://www.qcc.cuny.edu/socialsciences/ppecorino/medical_ethics_text/Chapter_2_Ethical_Traditions/Categorical_Imperative.htm in arguments for the Categorical Imperative over the Golden Rule,  

'Why should willingness to be on the receiving end of like action make it permissible? If masochists are willing to suffer others' sadism, would that make sadism right? More generally, can acceptance of being on the receiving end of like action legitimate anything?'

This is a valid question. Only that the Jewish and consequently Christian God has Laws that do not allow for masochism or any sort of evil. His Son, Jesus, referencing the Old Testament law given in Leviticus makes mention of the Golden Rule: 

Even though you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him! In everything, do to others what you would want them to do to you. This is what is written in the Law and in the Prophets.
Matthew 7:11‭-‬12 NIRV.

But Jesus doesn't stop with giving us that rule. Fulfilling the law, He gives a new commandment that encompasses every other commandment:

“I give you a new command. Love one another. You must love one another, just as I have loved you. If you love one another, everyone will know you are my disciples.”
John 13:34‭-‬35 NIRV

In the same way, husbands should love their wives. They should love them as they love their own bodies. Any man who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no one ever hated their own body. Instead, they feed and care for their body. And this is what Christ does for the church.
Ephesians 5:28‭-‬29 NIRV
(To understand these verses, in Christianity a couple is one entity. They're wholly joined before God. That is what the church is to Christ too, His body).

I think it can be argued that a masochist doesn't love themselves. And hasn't let God love them too. So concerning Christianity, the Categorical Imperative v Golden Rule argument is kinda moot. 
 

&gt;You mean that you knew was opposed to the bible or something else? 

James 4:17 NIV says If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn’t do it, it is sin for them. Here, sin is not only doing wrong but choosing to not do the good you should do. I will use myself as an example. So I went to the kitchen after I'd eaten to drop my plate. No one was eating with me at the time so my plate would be the dirty plate in the sink. I was feeling lazy so I seriously contemplated leaving it for my younger sister to wash whenever she saw it even though I knew that wouldn't be nice of me. After all, I was the one who used the plate. As I was leaving the kitchen, the words, 'If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn’t do it, it is sin for them' came to mind and I went back to wash the plate. God wouldn't like it if I left the plate there because someone else could wash it. The good thing would be for me to wash it. That's what I mean. 



&gt;That made me smile. You know that ""mistakes"" are when you do something wrong involuntarily, right? If you know its wrong and still do it, it's not a mistake.

You're right. Mistakes are when you do something wrong involuntarily and if you know something is wrong and still do it, it's a willful act. Let's just say I meant I've always known the thing to do and so I've really never had to learn from mistakes. And that when I actually did the wrong thing, they've been willful acts that I justified with curiosity. I don't mean they become okay to do simply because I'm curious. I mean that when my mind is telling me something is wrong to do, if I am curious enough, I would still go ahead to do it. I've quickly learned that it's foolish to do it because the outcome is always the same (me feeling stupid afterwards) so I don't do it. 

On the other hand, I definitely do not agree with the bible's stance on slavery. 

I don't know what stance you're talking about. Maybe you can explain? I do know that in the OT Laws, slaves are protected. 

If a slave comes to you for safety, don’t hand them over to their master. Let them live among you anywhere they want to. Let them live in any town they choose. Don’t treat them badly.
Deuteronomy 23:15‭-‬16 NIRV
https://bible.com/bible/110/deu.23.15-16.NIRV

“Keep the Sabbath day holy. Do this just as the Lord your God has commanded you. Do all your work in six days. But the seventh day is a sabbath to honor the Lord your God. Do not do any work on that day. The same command applies to your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, your oxen, your donkeys and your other animals. It also applies to any outsiders who live in your towns. I want your male and female servants to rest, just as you do. Remember that you were slaves in Egypt. The Lord your God reached out his mighty hand and powerful arm and brought you out of there. So the Lord your God has commanded you to keep the Sabbath day holy.

Funnily enough it was not that much of a barrier at all. I simply took an equivalency test in my home country and applied to study medicine in Italy (my mothers home country). The Italian system ranks applicants strictly on performance in an entry exam of logic puzzles and basic sciences. High school results play no role in your application. The only requirement is to have a State authority recognise you as a high school graduate or equivalent for matriculation. 

For about 6 months I studied basic sciences relentlessly. I simply studied straight out of High school Biology, Chemistry and Physics textbooks teaching myself the content and practicing similar questions in MCAT/BMAT question banks. It’s really unbelievable the difference you can have in your studies when you’re truly motivated, something I severely lacked throughout HS.

There were approximately 500 Applicants for my university, of which I ranked 6th (the top 50 gaining admission) and the next month I was on a flight back to Italy to start the 6 years of study! 

Thanks very much for the question. The reason I wanted to make this post is to let people know about how many opportunities there are if you look for them.

&gt;Not shocking, but making me even more adamant in not buying into it. Obviously any book that wants to be taken as ultimate, literal truth would state that ""anything against what is written there is false"". That's neither clever nor original. That's how all spammers work too! (And with the Quran there is at least a second book with the same claims and the same big follower-ship backing it up.)

Well, how about the parts where I say if you don't feel any peace with it and if it doesn't resonate with you? Why didn't you tie them in? If something is going to control you, it doesn't want you thinking for yourself or resonating with it and having to feel peace in your heart. It would just want you to do what it says like a mindless machine, regardless of what you're feeling. 


&gt;I really refer back to my original question: What is the reason to put the bible as foundation in the first place? Nothing in the bible can be responsible for it, or I could equally say ""Harry Potter"" is the one true book, because in Harry Potter it states that it is the one and only true book. (It actually doesn't in that book. Still a good read.)

Maybe you have the Bible confused with the Quran. The Bible doesn't say it is the one true book, even though it is to me. God says He is truth (if you think about it, assuming you believe in God, if he does exist and created everything, then He would be truth because we would all get our life from Him). However, when you read the Bible and the words resonate with you, you know it is inspired by Truth (God) because The Holy Spirit who guides us into all Truth will teach it to us. God's Words are His Life and the Bible is His Word recorded to man. Hence, the Bible is Truth. And the Bible doesn't force you to believe it, you either believe it or you don't. The choice is up to you. 

&gt;An yes, I know your answer to this and why you believe it to be true. I'm not even arguing against it, but that doesn't make it true in general. I have read the bible. It does not make me want to believe in it at all. So the bible itself obviously does not hold the ultimate power to make one a believer. So maybe god enlightens people who read the bible to belief? (Like yourself.) Maybe. But not for me. So either God doesn't want me that strongly to belief or the sentiment again is just not worth it. I'm sure God (if existing and interested in that) could make everybody who reads the bible be 'enlightened'. Would be easy. Would not even take away personal choices or such.

It's not God that doesn't want you to believe in Him. You're a skeptic. You won't believe His Word. How would a relationship go between two people when one doesn't trust and is always questioning the other? Nowhere. 

&gt;So the bible itself obviously does not hold the ultimate power to make one a believer.

Nothing and no one holds the power to make one a believer. You believe by yourself. You, a single entity who is responsible for and in control of your life. 

&gt;So either God doesn't want me that strongly to belief or the sentiment again is just not worth it. I'm sure God (if existing and interested in that) could make everybody who reads the bible be 'enlightened'. Would be easy. Would not even take away personal choices or such.

God does not make anyone do anything, even believe. The truth is He wants your love and He wants to be wanted.

Basically since I was socialised like a girl, and interpreted as one, I learnt how to do all of the social stuff to survive fast.

The God who by inspiration gave words to His prophet and people couldn't explain the human story all at once. He gave inspiration to each messenger in the OT and then Jesus fulfilled them in the NT. 

I think you didn't understand me when I said pick or choose. No one picked and chose the books in the Bible. The OT were written by the prophets of the Jews and the NT by Jesus' disciples. I meant that some Christian denominations pick and choose what they want to believe in the Bible. They alter it to fit their perceptions of God. For example, let's say you were a Christian and you believed in God but you read something in the Bible that you didn't want to accept, you would come up with your own excuses for not accepting it and justify it. Hence, you create your own theory. If you're able to convince others of it and they follow it, it becomes a doctrine that you not only believe but other people believe too. 

I'm not picking on anyone but the Jehovah's Witnesses was started because it's founder couldn't reconcile himself with the fact that God could create a Hell and that Jesus is God. Hence he comes up with a Jesus who is the Great Teacher and not God and a world where there is no Hell. Those aren't truth. That's a lie but he so badly wanted to believe it that he ran with it. And then got others to believe it because they also wanted so badly to believe it. And that's how the Jehovah's Witnesses is born. That is a man's doctrine. Not God's. 

Well, if no citation of a holy text will ever convince you, it's your choice. Only with Christians, the paper and ink and print aren't what's holy. It's the words in the Bible and it's because they're Life and they work on the heart. For example, there was this time someone kinda spoilt my phone charger. It was still functioning but sort of on its last leg and I was getting nervous about it and I was worried it would get totally ruined before I could get a new one. And the words in Philippians 4:6 (be anxious for nothing), seemingly out of nowhere just come up in my heart, literally startling me. I physically froze outwardly like someone was talking to me but those words were in my heart. And it was weird at the time because no one was talking to me. But God did. And it's because I knew the Word. He just brought it to my remembrance. 


&gt;You can't use a thing to prove the very thing itself, that's a circle. It's like answering the question ""Why is something?"" with ""Because it is so!"".

I know I've given you enough answers with spiritual evidence for you to know that I haven't believed on what the Bible says because it is so. I have told you I felt Joy. I have told you I read it for myself. I have told you the Holy Spirit makes it come alive to me and that it is spending time with God. I have told you I have prayed for things and those prayers have been answered. I have given you my reasons. I just haven't given you any of the reasons you want to hear. 

At that time Jesus prayed this prayer: “O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, thank you for hiding these things from those who think themselves wise and clever, and for revealing them to the childlike.  Yes, Father, it pleased you to do it this way!
Matthew 11:25‭-‬26 NLT

At that time Jesus said, “I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth [I openly and joyfully acknowledge Your great wisdom], that You have hidden these things [these spiritual truths] from the wise and intelligent and revealed them to infants [to new believers, to those seeking God’s will and purpose]. Yes, Father, for this way was well-pleasing in Your sight.
Matthew 11:25‭-‬26 AMP

I related to every symptom so much! About 3 months following I was out with a dear friend at the pub and told them about this, they are non binary and very poetic/artsy, and they asked if I'd ever considered autism.

It reframed my perception of what it meant and so I looked into it further. Previously doctors had diagnosed me with generalised anxiety disorder and OCD, I went to a psychiatrist and got evaluated, I showed up ADHD, BPD likely and autism possible. I then went to a psych another friend recommended who specialises in autism and she said I was definitely autistic in 20 minutes and not BPD and not OCD.

&gt;If you don't feel any peace regarding their message and resonate with it in your heart and (this will be shocking to you) if they say something that's contrary to what is written in the Bible, then pay them no mind. They're definitely not from God. That's the test.

Not shocking, but making me even more adamant in not buying into it. Obviously any book that wants to be taken as ultimate, literal truth would state that ""anything against what is written there is false"". That's neither clever nor original. That's how all spammers work too! (And with the Quran there is at least a second book with the same claims and the same big follower-ship backing it up.)

I really refer back to my original question: What is the reason to put the bible as foundation in the first place? Nothing *in* the bible can be responsible for it, or I could equally say ""Harry Potter"" is the one true book, because in Harry Potter it states that it is the one and only true book. (It actually doesn't in that book. Still a good read.)  
Unless somebody, somehow can proof to me, that a holy book is indeed the one and only true holy book, citing from it is meaningless. (It can still contain human wisdom).   


An yes, I know *your* answer to this and why *you* believe it to be true. I'm not even arguing against it, but that doesn't make it true in general. I have read the bible. It does not make me want to believe in it at all. So the bible itself obviously does not hold the ultimate power to make one a believer. So maybe god enlightens people who read the bible to belief? (Like yourself.) Maybe. But not for me. So either God doesn't want me that strongly to belief or the sentiment again is just not worth it. I'm sure God (if existing and interested in that) could make everybody who reads the bible be 'enlightened'. Would be easy.

You don’t have to show yourself, not at all, there’s two ways for a client to reach you and that is through the website and seeing your listing there, or by calling the 1-800 number and selecting you based on your voice and what you may have said during the 15 second recorded greeting. It seems most traffic comes from the website, so if you lack images on your profile it will likely not attract much attention. The images you show on your profile is up to you and can be as classy as you want them to be. Showing a little skin does help, so a bra and pantie pic can do really well, even if you don’t want to show your face. Secondly, you don’t even have to use your own pictures. If you’ve purchased content to use, as long as the model is 18 years of age or older, that’s also okay. There are plenty of people who use fake profiles.

I don’t know if my company is global however they do extend outside of North America. I know there are plenty of girls on the site from Europe as well, but idk about outside of NA and EU, though I suspect that yes, it is global.

Just look up companies and then research those companies. Find out if they have a good amount of traffic, find out the payout (My company allows me to keep 70% of what I make,) and anything else you may want to know.",,,1619977510,{},gwot3ae,True,t3_n37ffb,False,True,t1_gwoosn5,/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwot3ae/,1620007512,1,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],,

* Curiosity and Rationality: I have always been a rational person from a very young age, and I can't help but question everything. So I think there is an element of luck to it.
* Empathy: Islamic treatment towards women and minorities is disgusting. It is very human to empathize with the sufferings of others which lead me to question certain aspects of Islam.
* Studying Islam: As most of my questions couldn't be answered by society I turned to Islam which made things more confusing for me. The more I studied Islam, the more I grew distant from it as the things taught in the classroom or by our parents are very different from the things in the Quran or Sunnah.
* Internet: I think the most vital role in my journey was played by the internet, talking to people from different backgrounds, gaining knowledge about the other side, studying western, eastern, and modern philosophies, and simply seeing the effects of Islam globally changed me.

Adding to the family part. Pakistani families are very well integrated and distant members of the family are very closely bonded, most of my family (uncles and aunts) are very religious and if they found out about it, I am sure I would be disowned along with my parents.

This is not even the worst part. Most people accused of blasphemy never make it to the court, they are killed by violent mobs and the killers are often celebrated.

Yes, Pakistan is very conservative when it comes to the clothing of women, but it varies by area and demographics. Universities and developed cities are relatively open-minded about how women dress.

For example, I've manipulated my mothers tenants into doing housework for her, paying extra months etc. I'm rewarded from the satisfaction of doing slmerhing positive for my mother while simultaneously providing a means to minimizing how upset she can be when I intentionally do something that will upset her in the near future. 

Peopke believe that all sociopaths are completely devoid of empathy. This is not entirely the case- I do feel pity, guilt, shame and remorse but pretty much only when I've unintentionally harmed a weak individual. I very conciously do not prey on the weak, as not only do I feel bad for it but the rewards are not great. Instead, I very much ENJOY (gain and game) finding and exploiting the vulnerabilities and needs of people in positions of power or overabundance. I get more out of it and I'm very entertained by the process.

The first time I was 11 and taking a required music class. We were learning about notes and scales and such, and I was totally lost even though it tried really hard. One day my teacher held me back after class and had me face the wall. He played two notes on the piano and asked me if they were the same. I said I had no idea. He played two notes again, and I still had no idea. Then he told me that I was tone-deaf, which was “like being color-blind but for music.” I asked him if I was going to fail his class and he said, “no! Just show up on time and have fun, and you’ll get an A.” So I did that for three years, and always got As. 

I didn’t really understand or internalize that experience though and in my early 20’s I decided to teach myself guitar since I had an old one laying around. I couldn’t figure out how a person could tell if an instrument was out of tune or distinguish between notes, chords, etc. It all sounded the same to me and after a few months of trying I realized it wasn’t “just clicking” like I assumed it eventually would.

---------|----------|----------|
Do you ever wish you weren't born this way?|Sometimes, yes. It's tough navigating a world designed for hearing and there are a ton of people who just don't want to put in even a fraction of the effort I'm putting in to make it accessible. I've learned a lot through adversity and wouldn't trade my experiences for anything. But doesn't mean I don't wish I wasn't deaf. COVID has been maddening as I rely on lip reading and masks have been a huge barrier with that.  Growing up, it was more frequently that I wished I wasn't deaf. But now it's more if something I've learned to get used to and doesn't bother me as much anymore.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2td8l/im_stone_cold_deaf_ama/gwlj0ey/)
Did you learn proper English grammar in high school? I have a good buddy who is deaf and was educated in deaf schools. He said he was behind in college because he didn't learn proper English grammar until he went to college.|English was my first language. I grew up a voracious reader and learned how to speak and write English. I went to regular schools and took a couple of AP English classes. I did not start learning sign language until my last year of high school. I guess you could say I am the opposite of your buddy. My sign language was behind until I really started to pick it up in college. Now I prefer to communicate using sign language.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2td8l/im_stone_cold_deaf_ama/gwltsli/)
You have a great attitude! Is it a genetic condition? If so are any of your family members also deaf?|Thank you for the kind words. I'm still blessed to have what I have today and to be where I am. Being deaf has simultaneously been the most amazing and most frustrating part of my life.  No, it is not genetic. I was born with deformed hair cells in my inner ears. None of my family members or my children are deaf.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2td8l/im_stone_cold_deaf_ama/gwlzs6j/)
When did your parents realize you were deaf?|I was past two years old when I was officially diagnosed with hearing loss. Before that, my parents thought I was just a ""perfect"" baby because I slept through everything. When I got a bit older, my parents started noticing I was not responding to sounds like I should be so they took me to the doctor. They told me they went to three doctors who told them I was fine and to not worry about anything. It was only the fourth doctor who referred them to an audiologist, who then ran some tests and confirmed their suspicions.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2td8l/im_stone_cold_deaf_ama/gwmky4q/)
Do you feel like you are better than average at picking up on body language?|You know the saying that if a person loses or doesn't have one of their five senses, another sense is enhanced. Well I also have horrible eyesight so I didn't get any help in that area either. Thank goodness for prescription eyeglasses and contact lenses.  However, I do feel like my sense of perception is more advanced than my hearing counterparts. Since I don't have noise surrounding me all the time, I rely much more on visual cues, such as body language, to supplement/replace my lack of hearing.  Sometimes I feel like Shawn Spencer from Psych if you've ever watched that TV show. I catch a lot of things most people overlook.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2td8l/im_stone_cold_deaf_ama/gwlqpey/)
Have you watched the movie “A silent Voice”?|I have not. I'm not too much into anime.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2td8l/im_stone_cold_deaf_ama/gwm28ph/)
do you know sign language?|Yes, I do! While English was my first language growing up, I prefer to use sign language nowadays as my primary form of communication.  I started learning when I was a senior in high school and have been using sign language since.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2td8l/im_stone_cold_deaf_ama/gwm54fi/)
do you hear your own thought?|English was my first language and I learned how to speak and lip read. I don't know if I can define it as ""hearing"" my thoughts, but I think and ""communicate"" with my thoughts in English.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2td8l/im_stone_cold_deaf_ama/gwmriac/)
Do you have any idea what words and letters sound like, or do you just know how to move your mouth to make the letters you want? How did you communicate in order to learn how to speak? I'm very interested in linguistics, but I've never really considered how deaf people who speak interact with spoken language.|I started speech therapy at a very young age, I would guess 4 or 5 years old. I don't exactly remember how it started and how I first learned to form sounds. I was in speech therapy until I was 16 years old. I could never hear enough to distinguish between different sounds, so I focused on mouth movements to form sounds. It's different for each deaf person who learns to speak, but for me the toughest sounds to make are the ""j"" and ""ch"" sounds.  My speech therapists would help me ""feel"" the sounds in my throat. I also picked up a lot on how to pronounce words by watching people speak. I would watch TV with closed captions, read the captions quickly enough that I could then shift over to watch the character actually say the words and I picked up on how they would move their mouths or how some words look like they're pronounced one way, but the actual pronunciation is completely different.  When I use my voice nowadays, I'm pretty careful about my word choice and will sometimes actually plan what I'm going to say in advance so I can avoid tougher to pronounce words and think of easier words or phrases that mean the same thing instead. It can be a lot of work just to have a 2 minute conversation...|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2td8l/im_stone_cold_deaf_ama/gwmrrji/)
Do you believe lack of hearing changes your sense of time|I'm not sure what you mean by this. You mean does time go by slower for me? I don't think so. Sometimes people will comment something took forever, but I thought it went by quickly and vice versa. One thing I do struggle though with is running long distances. Most people will use music or podcasts or something to help pass the time. I don't have that luxury so running a half marathon does feel like forever to me. Other than that, I haven't really noticed a significant difference in perception of time, I guess.  Hope that answered your question.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2td8l/im_stone_cold_deaf_ama/gwmsjki/)
Do you think any of your other senses is way above average?|My other four senses are pretty average or below average. My eyesight is terrible.  However, I do think I have an enhanced sense of perception. Without noise to bother me, I rely more on visual cues and I notice things many people don't. People think Deaf people can't drive, but we are actually probably the safest drivers because we have a stronger sense of perception and pay more attention to the road.  Sometimes I feel like Shawn Spencer from Psych if you've ever watched that. I'm really observant.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2td8l/im_stone_cold_deaf_ama/gwmzhwh/)

I do think the great replacement is probably true.
3. I used to have a political group just for iranian nazis, and i am in alot of national socialist telegram groups, i do look up to people such as tom sewell, martinez perspective, aryan bacon and others
4. I don't have that much really, i dont argue with people online since its a waste of time and achieves no purpose. The only difficulty i would have is probably is trying to explain something in real life, since i cant tell them to search up a certain thing.

[],,Sefay7,,,[],,,,text,t2_a4ix8kos,False,False,[],"Hello. It's the person with the I'm a Christian, AMA again. It has been on my mind to write you again. I sense that my answer wasn't satisfactory enough. Like I didn't explain things well enough to you. So I'd like to be able to do that again, if it's okay. So here goes:

I will explain why there's a Hell in the first place. God has always existed before He ever created the world we're in now. There was and still is the spiritual world with God and angelic beings. Satan (the devil) was one of them until he decided to rebel against God. God tells Ezekiel this (and us too) in Ezekiel 28:12 - 19(NLT) : 

12 “Son of man, sing this funeral song for the king of Tyre. Give him this message from the Sovereign Lord : “You were the model of perfection, full of wisdom and exquisite in beauty. 

13 You were in Eden, the garden of God. Your clothing was adorned with every precious stone — red carnelian, pale-green peridot, white moonstone, blue-green beryl, onyx, green jasper, blue lapis lazuli, turquoise, and emerald— all beautifully crafted for you and set in the finest gold. They were given to you on the day you were created.

14 I ordained and anointed you as the mighty angelic guardian. You had access to the holy mountain of God and walked among the stones of fire.

15 “You were blameless in all you did from the day you were created until the day evil was found in you.

16 Your rich commerce led you to violence, and you sinned. So I banished you in disgrace from the mountain of God. I expelled you, O mighty guardian, from your place among the stones of fire.

17 Your heart was filled with pride because of all your beauty. Your wisdom was corrupted by your love of splendor. So I threw you to the ground and exposed you to the curious gaze of kings.

18 You defiled your sanctuaries with your many sins and your dishonest trade. So I brought fire out from within you, and it consumed you. I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the sight of all who were watching. 

19 All who knew you are appalled at your fate. You have come to a terrible end, and you will exist no more.”


In Isaiah 14(NLT), there's also mention of the devil's fall in verses 12 to 17: 

12 “How you are fallen from heaven, O shining star, son of the morning! You have been thrown down to the earth, you who destroyed the nations of the world. 

13 For you said to yourself, ‘I will ascend to heaven and set my throne above God’s stars. I will preside on the mountain of the gods far away in the north. 

14 I will climb to the highest heavens and be like the Most High.’ 

15 Instead, you will be brought down to the place of the dead, down to its lowest depths. 


These verses show you that Satan was one of the angels of God, blameless until he was consumed with pride and as a result, committed evil. He decided that he wanted to be God, forgetting that the created can never be greater than the Creator and got punished for it. The punishment was he got sent to Hell. So Hell wasn't created for humans. It is important that you know and understand that. It's also important you understand that Satan is the originator and father of evil. There was no such thing as evil until it was found in him. 

Now, as I've told you before, the devil knows he's condemned to Hell and since he's spiteful (you know, being evil), he decides again to bring humans (God's loved creation) under condemnation and judgement. He does this by deceiving Adam and Eve, getting them to eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, thereby bringing sin and evil into the world (you'll see this in the book of Genesis). He (Satan) also gets the authority over the earth given by God to Adam through his deception. So he begins to influence men's thoughts and actions, tempting them to commit evil. Conversely, even as Satan tempts men to commit evil, he also accuses them before God and in their hearts also. The devil is the accuser of the brethren:

Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: “Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Messiah. For the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down.
Revelation 12:10 NIV


To explain how Satan does this in the lives of Christians, I am including a quote from this weblink, https://www.ficm.org.uk/node/528:

Satan often uses temptation and accusation as a brutal one-two punch. He comes along and says, ""Why don't you try it? Everybody does it. Besides, you can get away with it. Who's going to know?"" Then as soon as we fall for his tempting line, he changes his tune to accusation: ""What kind of a Christian are you to do such a thing? You're a pitiful excuse for a child of God. You'll never get away with it. You might as well give up because God has already given up on you.""

But enough about that, we humans also have a conscience and when we do wrong, we know it. And since God is good and just and righteous, and demands righteousness from us, humans are under judgement to Hell. 


Romans 3:10-14:

10 As it is written: “There is no one righteous, not even one;  

11 there is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God.  

12 All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one.”  

13 “Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit.” “The poison of vipers is on their lips.”  

14 “Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.”  ruin and misery mark their ways,  and the way of peace they do not know.”  “There is no fear of God before their eyes.”

There's no perfect human who hasn't lied or done bad things so it's correct to say we're all under that judgement. When a sin is committed, someome has to pay for that sin. In the Old Testament, with God and the Jews, whenever they committed a sin, they had to confess it before the Levitical priest and bring an animal sacrifice. Their sins would be transferred to and paid for by that animal until they committed another sin and had to bring another sacrifice because the blood of animals is not enough to purify a man.

God knew that and so He sent His Son, Jesus, fully God and man, perfect and blameless into the world so that He could pay for our sins. John 1:29 NIV - The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!

John 3:

16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 

17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 

The crucifixion of Jesus was His sacrifice: God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
2 Corinthians 5:21 NIV

Romans 3 NIV:
23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 

24 and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith. 

25 He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished— 

26 he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.

All men are condemned to be punished as a result of sin to Hell and the only thing that can redeem them from that punishment is belief in Jesus Christ. Belief in Jesus justifies us and we become the righteousness of God. We no longer have to worry about being bad or good. We just think like God thinks and do as He would do, something the Holy Spirit helps us out with that. And in our spirit there is love and joy and peace and every good thing you can think of given to us a as a gift from God:

But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.
Galatians 5:22‭-‬26 NIV

I can't tell you what the best solution is, but I'd recommend you to change something. And don't hesitate to ask for help, this can also be professional help. Drug and also psychological issues are something that is hard to deal alone with.

Let me tell you something. A few years ago, in the end of my 20's, I was really stuck as well. I did not have any drug issues and I think it's not completly comparable. After several rejection from women I liked I thought, nobody will ever love me. I was studying, but it was a burden and no fun anymore. I had to fight to get out of bed in the morning. I was depressed.

Luckily I got out of there alone, but I know, that this is not a matter of course. I was lucky and I should have asked for help.

There was a moment, where I thought about, what I would like to do right now. I always wanted to travel the world. But when I was younger, I had no money. Now I was stuck in studies and my student job, with also not enough money. I had no time for that. So, I decided to quit my master. I asked my employer, to start full time. They accepted and from this moment on, I felt already much better. I had made a change, and had a new objectiv: Travel to Australia. I saved money for one year and went there. At the first days in a hostel, I met a travelling woman. Today she is my wife, and I have a happy life.

What I'm trying to say is, you are young and it is never to late to change something. Even if you think, you have a shitty life right now, better times will come. Don't give in. It will get better.

I can tell you *lots* of stories how groceries depended on foot stamps, how electronic engeneering was redeveloping what already existed in the west, how hard it was to hunt for a flat, how a car had a waiting list of 10+ years, ...

That being said I'm also aware how more often than not the communist movement sized power from a society that still had a feudal system in place bringing a initial betterment of living conditions. (That is, if there was no famine due to this or that uncooked decision of the leading party: like the chinese idea to kill all sparrows - who would have though those insects eat the crops much faster then?). But feeding the world is not a project that can catch you nowadays votes in a western society. If anything forcefully bringing down the average meet consumption to \~ 300g/week as is highly recommended form a environmental point of view would propably be a highly unpopular decision and requires some benefits in other areas of society to maintain popularity.

[],,TheAmmiSquad,,,[],,,,text,t2_9pe5ixu,False,False,[],"Fair question! Prefacing: I am not an expert on scripture or Islam as a religion, merely a learner and a follower. I do recognize that the stories related in the Quran are not monolithically interpreted, but reflect the sociological, sectarian and academic context of the interpreter. 

The cited example of Sodom and Gomorrah talks about a number of sins including male homosexuality, pervasive indiscriminate adultery,  non-consensual sodomy of guests and travelers, looting and robbing, various other violations of the rights of guests but also critically refusing to believe in one God and not listening to the teachings of the Prophet Lut. These acts are also not spoken off as isolated transgressions so much as a pervasive part of the culture and the way of living for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. Was men laying with other men the tipping point when God decided to destroy them? That inference, I think is more a function of the politics and culture of the purveyors of Islam, especially when they became more Wahabbi in the last couple or centuries. 

Only Allah knows the absolute truth but I also can't deny that most Islamic jurisprudence does condemn homosexuality as a sin. This debate itself has led to a lot of internal turmoil. Am I unquestionably gay? I have come to realize that I am. Am I then an abomination and does God deem my mere existence and identity a punishable offence? This I pursue differently from the law, as I do believe far more in the mercy, kindness and acceptance of Allah than of the people who interpret and enforce Islamic law.

I thought I was gay when I was maybe 13-14 and actively hated myself for it and tried to suppress it. I always attributed it to my sexual abuse as a child and how that perhaps made me a sexual deviant. It led to suicidal thoughts and multiple suicide attempts exacerbated by the BPD. It has taken a lot of praying but I do believe that I am OK with who I am now. At a personal level, I also believe that Allah accepts me for who I am. 

Not sure if both of these aspects of my identity CAN co-exist but they ARE co-existing. I am gay (something I know to be objectively true) and I am muslim (I believe, I pray and I give charity in the name of Allah). The choice to deny or accept that truth is your right, but I hope in your heart, you also recognize that there is a Higher Power far better positioned to judge me fairly than you or our fellow human beings.",,,1619939612,{},gwmu05p,True,t3_n2dwji,False,True,t1_gwlqtni,/r/AMA/comments/n2dwji/gay_muslim_man_in_his_mid30s_csa_survivor_and_bpd/gwmu05p/,1619966168,1,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],,

Long answer: after college, I was in massive student loan debt and went nuts paying them off because I couldn’t stand being in debt (my folks were lower middle class and always living paycheck to paycheck). So I worked for a year and a half, while taking 80-90% of every paycheck and paying down my student loans until I paid them off. After I did, I felt like I’d lost part of my life working a job that I hated just trying to get out of debt. So I wanted to get out and live doing something I always wanted too (see the world). So in 2016, I backpacked 3000 miles throughout the US and caught the travel bug. My friend suggested I get a van to upgrade my travel style. So I spent another year and half converting it and now I’m working on hitting up all 50 states! 😄

1) I am a huge fan of provolone. It's the best for sandwiches, but I like to just eat it too. (I just DON'T because it's expensive. Lol.)

2) I had the biggest awkward crush on my senior year english teacher. She was fresh out of college and only 4 years older than me. She was SO cute and physically...omg. I wanted her BAD. And on top of that, her name was Jennifer, but she went by Jenny, (only to other staff, of course) which only made her that much cuter to me. I've never seen an ugly Jennifer.

3) I would buy a lot of video game stuff that I've always wanted. A few pinball tables for sure. A NICE comfortable gaming chair. I'd get some models that I've always wanted, too. A big Enterprise-D replica from Star Trek: The Next Generation. That's all I can think of rn. Lol.

But using the average of moving a lot (this is more like driving around for fun to national parks and stuff)

$320 gas/month

More realistic (not constantly moving every day)

$160 gas/month

I have a fridge, so I rarely eat out. I can get by on around $30 bucks a week.

But sometimes you crave a big burger 🍔

So high end (eating out a few times a week $60/week - $240 food/month)

Low end $30/week - $120 food/month

Bills

Vehicle Insurance I pay once a year $780 rather than month to month

Phone/internet $130/month this is high because I have unlimited data and a mobile WiFi. Need it for working (I work remotely)

I’m just kidding lol a few years ago there was a test I was doing called an allomap and it was to try to catch rejection with a blood test instead of a full biopsy. But it never really took off.  The life expectancy is around 11 years. However that takes into account people who don’t take their meds or die of other unrelated issues. The record I believe is 34 years and he died of old age|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2nn28/today_i_celebrate_15_years_since_my_heart/gwklnxn/)
Not a question, but glad you're doing ok!|Thank you!  I sometimes forget it even happened, life just kept going on|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2nn28/today_i_celebrate_15_years_since_my_heart/gwkpu3v/)
Amazing! Congrats on living your second live. Is there anything you can cherish or enjoy more than you did before your transplant?|I cherish my stepmom (now adopted mom) and dad more than anything. They never left my side for a day. They slept on the hospital room window sill for over a month to sleep in my room with me. I can’t thank them enough in life|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2nn28/today_i_celebrate_15_years_since_my_heart/gwkrb77/)
Did getting the new heart lead to new tastes for things in life? If so, which ones?|It did not! But I can no longer eat apple sauce or drink root beer. But that’s just because I used to use them to take my meds when I was younger and now it’s gross|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2nn28/today_i_celebrate_15_years_since_my_heart/gwl9ast/)
That’s amazing, wishing you the best!  Does it “feel” any different than your last heart?|Funny story! Before my transplant my heart was done. Like I was the first of 3 kids to have adult BIVADS put in him to keep the heart pumping.  When I finally got my new heart, within the first week, when I was laying in bed I would hear this weird banging against the wall behind and I couldn’t figure out what it was. Turns out, my heart was beating so powerfully it was banging the headboard of the hotel room bed against the wall|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2nn28/today_i_celebrate_15_years_since_my_heart/gwld3p3/)
Did the heart transplant change you attitude to life or affirm it?|Honestly it was a blessing in disguise. Yes I almost died.. a few times.. but in that happening I started a new life and honestly in the situation I was in before hand, I might have been dead by now already|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2nn28/today_i_celebrate_15_years_since_my_heart/gwljozp/)
simple question how much did it cost? if you can, break down what the costs are. thanks!|I can’t really give you a full breakdown, I was a young child (12) when it happened. But my father has said at the point it was up towards 1 million|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2nn28/today_i_celebrate_15_years_since_my_heart/gwlmd3a/)
Do you have a mind link to your donor?|No, honestly the hearts job is to pump blood to the body as far as I can see. Nothing really changed for me emotionally|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2nn28/today_i_celebrate_15_years_since_my_heart/gwlxxay/)

I would say it took me probably 3 or 4 years before I really felt comfortable and fluent using ASL. Now, even after 10+ years, I'm still learning new things every day as I meet and interact with other ASL users.

Long answer: after college, I was in massive student loan debt and went nuts paying them off because I couldn’t stand being in debt (my folks were lower middle class and always living paycheck to paycheck). So I worked for a year and a half, while taking 80-90% of every paycheck and paying down my student loans until I paid them off. After I did, I felt like I’d lost part of my life working a job that I hated just trying to get out of debt. So I wanted to get out and live doing something I always wanted too (see the world). So in 2016, I backpacked 3000 miles throughout the US and caught the travel bug. My friend suggested I get a van to upgrade my travel style.

1. I see them about once a week ( in the spring/ summer / early fall ) due to my schedule. Depending on the weather and what we are doing I’m out there for about 2-3 hours. In the fall/ winter/ early spring we easily spend 2-4 hours cleaning up our yard and planting + adding things such as weights to our hives. 

2. I think right now we are at 6, 7, or 8 hives? I can’t remember for sure. 

3. Depends on the year. The money doesn’t go individually to me either but rather towards funding for our group to buy more suits, gloves, etc. We actually got a grant last year from our local rotary club to help fund us too! I don’t do this for a job or for money but rather for a hobby and the environment.

4. Again, depends on the year. It depends on a lot of things really. How many bees you have, how much foliage is near, and most importantly is your goal this year to create bees or honey? (for yourself that is, because extra honey is for yourself as you regularly need that honey to feed your bees). This year we kept it for the bees.

I knew mine at 3 and I’ve spent my whole life building a career around working with venomous snakes.  Outside of my lab I don’t know anyone else whose figured out a similar subject they’re passionate enough about that they would “work” (including the boring parts) for free.  There’s absolutely no reason to believe we all have something we are passionate about.  

I also didn’t say that no one would be happier not working... I’m sure many would be... I’m saying it would likely be different than what people expect.  If someone has anxiety issues about money many would probably find another subject to be anxious about if money wasn’t an issue.  If you’re starving or freezing because of that lack of money I’m not talking about you.  

My point is this... what do you expect your life would be like if you got $70,000 a year no matter what you did?  What things that you dislike about your life do you  think would go away?  Do you think every day would feel like one of your days off?  Better?  Worse?  Have you ever been unhappy during a summer vacation when you were too young to work full time?

I can't even begin to fathom what it must feel like to not have the worry of bills, feeding your family, or where you'll live in the next week. So I'm curious, do you have friends who are not as fortunate as you, or do you surround yourself mostly with those who are rich as well? I've always had this image that the rich only hang with the rich. Forgive me if I'm wrong, which I probably am, I don't know any billionaires.

Nice dude. I actually just got word yesterday that I'm taking over some accounts at work which means commission on top of my base salary, so I hope to pull in about 110k USD this year.  I know for me, I put a lot of pressure on myself because it already feels like a lot of money but I know I'm just getting to a place where I can actually have a life worth living, pay off my student loans aggressively with savings and retirement (in such a high cost-of-living city).  Do you feel more pressure at the 6 figure level than previously?|Not so much.

A bit of bullying but not that much, mostly being left out in school. Felt very alone and that was the worse. My family was a bit dysfunctional, my dad probably has some major issues that he never bothered to check out so there was a lot of bad feelings at home. He never hit us or anything like that but were very harsh when you did something wrong and yelled a lot. You always had to be the grown up with him because he would never accept that he was wrong. He was also very mean to my mum and fought a lot with my brothers when they were teenagers. So when I was like six years old he started to have less controll over his anger and it was very scary for a little kid.

[],,MarbCart,,,[],,,,text,t2_11jdompj,False,False,[],"Wow. You have a very narrow understanding of how trauma works. It can manifest in so many different ways. The way *you* responded to trauma is not the *only* way to respond. 

I’m going to break down your assumptions and give examples of other interpretations. These are all based on my own experiences, as well as conversations with others who have been through similar things, and findings from experts. 

1. *It must be a kink because they keep discussing physical details*. Rape victims often feel they have to justify their trauma by explaining exactly what lead to the event(s). Especially in the case of male rape victims, they are often accused of lying because people believe if you had an erection then you must have wanted it. This is NOT true. A physiological response to stimulation does NOT equal mentally/emotionally/spiritually wanting it. This happens to women too. Our bodies sometimes self lubricate in instances of rape, as a coping mechanism to lessen the physical trauma. It doesn’t mean it was wanted.
2. *Its doubtful that someone would be unable to get an erection for two years after being raped*. MANY rape victims have sexual dysfunction issues for years afterwards. I actually never saw OP say they couldn’t get erections so I won’t speak on that; what I did see was that they couldn’t have sex for 2 years afterwards. I personally couldn’t have sex for 7 years afterwards. I had a panic attack every time I tried, and after a while I just gave up entirely for a long time. I was only able to overcome this due to therapy and supportive partners, just like OP. 
3. *Nobody would make a “flippant” post and then delete it.* First of all, I didn’t think it was flippant. You don’t have to be shaking and sobbing every time you talk about being raped for it to be real. Lots of people process their trauma through casual discussion. That’s why there are so many “Haha I’m suicidal” jokes these days. It’s a way of coping. People also routinely change their minds about these kinds of posts. Two years after I was raped, I wrote a descriptive post on tumblr, and then deleted it 24 hours later. Six years after the rape, I made the following graphic post on Reddit and deleted it from a two minutes later (I will be sharing it in a nested comment under this one, under spoiler bars; I will be deleting it within the hour) (edit: I decided not to share it publicly from this account actually). 
4. You can be raped and unfortunately develop a kink as a coping mechanism. It happened to me. Sometimes the wires in your mind get crossed after going through something horrible like that, and you end up fantasizing about it. For me, that fantasy is so different from what I want in reality. To experience anything like in real life would be horrifying and traumatizing to me. And I am often disgusted and ashamed about it. But having a fantasy does NOT equal actually wanting to experience it in real life. This is a super common effect of sexual trauma. 
5. Basically sexual trauma can cause incredibly complex reactions. It can make you avoid sex for years, and it can also make you hyper sexual. It can make you have fantasies you would never want to experience in real life. It can make you share information and then decide to retract that information. 
6. Before you cast doubt on someone who says they are a victim of rape, consider what purpose that doubt serves. In this situation, I see no benefit to your doubt. Nobody is harmed by OP’s discussion of their trauma. But people are harmed by your judgmentalness, as it just reinforces the belief that victims, especially in this case male victims, should keep their trauma secret. Now, if they had named the perpetrator, that would be different. Sadly, there are **very rare** instances of people making false accusations for their own gain. One of my best friends was a victim of this. Her ex girlfriend was an emotionally abusive manipulative toxic narcissist. When they broke up, the ex posted on social media that my friend abusive. She was trying to ruin my friend’s career and social life as a form of revenge for the breakup. I do not condone blindly ostracizing the accused without evidence. But that is not what this post is doing. This is not a revenge post. The only people who should doubt victims are: defense at attorneys; juries; close friends of the accused; people considering hiring the accused. And even in those situations, you shouldn’t decide that someone is lying without very very very careful consideration.",,,1619898904,{},gwkueuq,False,t3_n0ff9a,False,True,t1_gwcoj1y,/r/AMA/comments/n0ff9a/im_a_guy_and_got_raped_by_a_women/gwkueuq/,1619925960,1,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],,

It can be pretty warm, and sometimes too warm. As for where I would like to live - I’m not really sure. I’d like to live in a big city like Dubai, maybe, or New York. I just can’t imagine living in a really small town.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2hkty/im_a_teenager_living_in_norway_ama/gwklauw/)

Do planes float in the sky?  My boyfriend and I have had this argument a lot lol. I fly UAVs, and I’ve tried explaining to him how action/reaction plus the Venturi effect is what causes lift, which is needed to have a plane fly. It has to be moving forward to cause lift, whereas floating is just the ability to “stay up” out of buoyancy, like a boat. It doesn’t have to move to float. So, do planes float in the sky?|Definitely not in the way that a ship can, a ship can stay still in water whereas a plane can't, and the definition of float is and I quote  &gt;rest or move on or near the surface of a liquid without sinking  Float means on a liquid, so in my books, no by definition planes do not float.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2gvab/im_a_commercial_airline_pilot_ama/gwjevyj/)

Now, be smart about it. You do not have unlimited money. It's very easy for people ""leveling up"" their salary to have ideas about what kind of lifestyle that ""should"" mean, and trying to make it happen.

Live below your means. Contribute as much as you can to your 401k. Take advantage of company matching. Start building a rainy-day savings. Your goal should be $20k locked in savings, easily accessible but you don't touch it unless you're in an ""emergency: break glass"" situation. You can dip into it as you're building it, but remain focused on building it. Even $250 a paycheck dropped in savings can add up quick.

I was where you are about 10 years ago. We had a LOT of debt because my wife was a ""level-up"" personality. I've learned that no matter how much you make, you can still very quickly get yourself into debt trouble. I only fully got out of that cycle and started paying it down about 9 years ago, and it took until earlier this year. Yes, really.

Question | Answer | Link
---------|----------|----------|
Why did you die?  Do you remember thinking anything just before your lost consciousness, like ‘oh shit this could be the end’?|I overdosed on a ton of drugs. And by that I don't mean a lot of one drug. I mean I was doing what was called candy flipping. Bowl of pills, grab a handful and enjoy.  I remember thinking ""this is a fucked up way to sober up..."" I wasn't really in a mental space to be thinking seriously about anything.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2hac5/im_a_40_year_old_man_who_has_been_resuscitated/gwj86at/)
You meet the one upstairs?|I remember nothing.  I don't mean I don't remember anything.  I remember a feeling of nothingness. It's so hard to explain.  It was terrifying and soothing at the same time.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2hac5/im_a_40_year_old_man_who_has_been_resuscitated/gwja8pu/)
Did your experience change how you view death?|Not really.  I've been shot several times, military and rough growing up. So I've never really ever been afraid to die.  It did change my perspective on what's important.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2hac5/im_a_40_year_old_man_who_has_been_resuscitated/gwjdga5/)
Who saved you?|The home owner when they noticed I was overdoing it. It wasn't the first time we'd partied and he knew my habit of going hard at the ""fun"".|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2hac5/im_a_40_year_old_man_who_has_been_resuscitated/gwjdq6g/)
What impact did 'being dead' have on your later life? We are curious to know what changes you have made to your life since then.|Basically changed how I viewed what was important and what wasn't.  I stopped sweating the little irritating things and started focusing on betterment of my life.  Taught me that fun isn't everything.  It wasn't really the effects it had on my life that opened my eyes, but the impact it had on others in my life.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2hac5/im_a_40_year_old_man_who_has_been_resuscitated/gwje0pc/)
Are you religious?|Nope. Not against it, but not for it.  Maybe something that lingered from my old life.  Live and let live?|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2hac5/im_a_40_year_old_man_who_has_been_resuscitated/gwjnyow/)
Did your heart stop and will you candy flip again??? Sounds like you might need to talk to some one about your risk taking my friend.|This was many years ago. And yeah. My heart stopped for 6 minutes. Thankfully the doc didn't stop the machine that was cracking my ribs and sternum before the narcan started to kick in.  I still take risks, but now it's which food I'm gonna get heartburn from.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2hac5/im_a_40_year_old_man_who_has_been_resuscitated/gwjpj34/)
What do you remember seeing or happening while dying?|Everyone freaking out was what I remember most. Me trying to tell everyone it was fine, I was fine, go back to the fun...  Then complaining to the paramedic that my chest hurt...  I only found out later that it was all an internal monologue.  Lots and lots of pain leading up to the blackout to nothing.  It was the single most painful experience I've ever had. During, but mostly afterwards during the recovery. I had just had my ribs broken, the sternum was the worst, but that was only a hairline fracture. But the recovery was also dealing with going pretty much cold turkey after a year and a half of 2 grand a week habits.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2hac5/im_a_40_year_old_man_who_has_been_resuscitated/gwjse24/)
Are you eligible for getting insurance coz you were technically dead?|Naw... I joined about it, but that's only for the totally living impaired.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2hac5/im_a_40_year_old_man_who_has_been_resuscitated/gwk1bmw/)
So was death really just nothingness? I’ve seen some of your other comments but I was interested. I’ve seen some people say it’s similar to what you said when they’ve been dead and revived. Could you possibly go into more detail or do you think it’s just really hard to explain?  I wish you luck and hope you’re in a better place in your life. Thanks for doing this!|Honestly I'm not really sure. Unfortunately this always seems to be one of those things that every answer breeds more questions.  I think I was never brain dead. So technically I was only mostly dead... Kinda like that scene in the princess bride...  But it really is hard to explain completely because it isn't something that is something you can kinda compare it to to form a comparison. It isn't like subbing your toe or getting a paper cut. Something that everyone has experienced.  You can always try to imagine feeling something. But to feel nothing? It's maddening but calming, the feeling that everything is nothing.  My thoughts were... I realized that I couldn't breathe, no, I'm not breathing. I don't ""feel"" I need to breathe. I'm not dizzy, but I don't know if I'm laying down, upside down, right side up. I can't feel anything, no cold, no heat, no pressure. It's dark, no, it's nothing. No light or anything.  Then, pain. Lots and lots of pain like everything my body has been used to, it wasn't anymore. Everything hurt. Gasping for air because I feel like I've suffocated, throat feels chalky and raw. I can't hear anything except blood rushing through my ears. Like you hear when you try to touch the bottom of the deep end of the pool, but louder. The light was insanely bright. My eyes were soaked, and I was freezing cold.  All of that in the first 5 seconds. Then, passing out with crazy vivid dreams. Woke up to friends crying over my bed.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2hac5/im_a_40_year_old_man_who_has_been_resuscitated/gwk1vlx/)
Were you aware of time while you were dead? Or was it more like a quick nap so to say?|It felt like an eternity and no time at all. All at the same time. The harder I think about it the quicker it seemed to have gone.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2hac5/im_a_40_year_old_man_who_has_been_resuscitated/gwk359e/)
what was it like being dead?|Everything was nothing.  No feeling, no comprehension of anything outside of your own thoughts.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2hac5/im_a_40_year_old_man_who_has_been_resuscitated/gwk5dqz/)
What did you see?|I saw nothing. Lots and lots of nothing.  It was as scary and calming as it sounds.  Reassuring and horribly unsettling.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2hac5/im_a_40_year_old_man_who_has_been_resuscitated/gwk6isw/)
How were you brought back? Defibrillators?|They used this big machine that they put over me that kept up chest compressions and had the shock stickers (electrodes) that shocked me if they pushed a button.  You can look on up on Google... Chest compressions machine... It looks brutal. And it freaking is.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2hac5/im_a_40_year_old_man_who_has_been_resuscitated/gwk6l8o/)

I think I was never brain dead. So technically I was only mostly dead... Kinda like that scene in the princess bride...

But it really is hard to explain completely because it isn't something that is something you can kinda compare it to to form a comparison. It isn't like subbing your toe or getting a paper cut. Something that everyone has experienced.

You can always try to imagine feeling something. But to feel nothing? It's maddening but calming, the feeling that everything is nothing.

My thoughts were... I realized that I couldn't breathe, no, I'm not breathing. I don't ""feel"" I need to breathe. I'm not dizzy, but I don't know if I'm laying down, upside down, right side up. I can't feel anything, no cold, no heat, no pressure. It's dark, no, it's nothing. No light or anything.

Then, pain. Lots and lots of pain like everything my body has been used to, it wasn't anymore. Everything hurt. Gasping for air because I feel like I've suffocated, throat feels chalky and raw. I can't hear anything except blood rushing through my ears. Like you hear when you try to touch the bottom of the deep end of the pool, but louder. The light was insanely bright. My eyes were soaked, and I was freezing cold.

Do you identify more as Bermudan or British?|Because of the rareness of my background I like to identify as Bermudian, however living in the UK I feel I have a right to call myself a British citizen. (But at heart I am Bermudian and proud! 🇧🇲)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1wfuq/im_from_bermuda_aka_the_bermuda_triangle_ama/gwfqeda/)
What is the weather like in the Bermuda Triangle? I feel like people and movies exaggerate the severity of the weather, but what is it actually like?|I'm in the upper part of the Bermuda triangle but I have taken cruise's further down. The weather is normal, but there is of course hurricane season where the weather can be very abrupt and deadly. But it's so normal and routine that locals are used to it.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1wfuq/im_from_bermuda_aka_the_bermuda_triangle_ama/gwfz5n8/)
Do you ever find yourself teleporting?|Spiritually? I believe so tehe. Physically? I could never know  unless I was concious the entire time.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1wfuq/im_from_bermuda_aka_the_bermuda_triangle_ama/gwg89ul/)
Where is it|It is a lonely spec in the western North Atlantic Ocean. We sit peacefully on top of a dead volcano 🌋|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1wfuq/im_from_bermuda_aka_the_bermuda_triangle_ama/gwh11rf/)
What’s the theory that rings most true to you about where planes and boats disappear to? (didn’t mean to rhyme)|I don't have the logic to back this but I remember someone saying something about there being a magnetic glitch in the Bermuda triangle that place a patch off the radar so objects and other radio waves couldn't locate missing ships and planes. The weather in here is extra violent because of this and they simply go unnoticed just like that.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1wfuq/im_from_bermuda_aka_the_bermuda_triangle_ama/gwhzol7/)
Do they talk about the Bermuda Triangle in Bermuda ? Like is Bermuda selfaware?|Maybe when you are younger like in primary school haha they actually have classes that teach you about the Bermuda triangle and it's mysteries surrounding it. Bermuda is very superstitious tho, so if you ask a Bermudian about it they will laugh because it's a stereotype of the island, but give the right person the right time and they will open right up and creep you the hell out with what they REALLY think is going on 👀|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1wfuq/im_from_bermuda_aka_the_bermuda_triangle_ama/gwjfbse/)
because of the stories Are you scared of getting on a plane or boat?|Not at all, not even as a kid, I guess it's because the island itself is so beautiful you forget. On the other end I've always seen myself as very Dearing, I'd almost challenge the whims of fate to see if something bad would happen or not due to the simple fact that it hasn't yet. The idea terrifies me but more so fascinates me.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1wfuq/im_from_bermuda_aka_the_bermuda_triangle_ama/gwfz0eo/)
How do the aliens look like?|By my surprise, they are us.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1wfuq/im_from_bermuda_aka_the_bermuda_triangle_ama/gwfqn9n/)
do  you like grilled cheese|I loved it... But now I'm vegan unfortunately. If I eat meat or cheese again willingly something catastrophic will happen, ripple effect and all. That and I can never drink alcohol, small prices to pay for my freedom.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1wfuq/im_from_bermuda_aka_the_bermuda_triangle_ama/gwhap0o/)

Just because we’re young it doesn’t mean we are irresponsible or that the pregnancy was an accident. I have a couple friends who’s pregnancies were surprises, but mine was planned.

I feel like I did when I was pregnant, I felt self conscious a lot... especially when my hands were too swollen to wear my wedding ring. I come from a religious background so I wanted people to know I wasn’t pregnant out of wedlock (nothing wrong with that, just not for me). 

I don’t know if it’s considered a challenge, but most of my friends aren’t at the same stage in their lives as I am... so we can’t relate the same way we used to. 

I wasn’t at the beginning, I had to increase my antidepressant dose, and see a post partum counsellor. But it’s starting to get better now, 5 months on. Still have bad days though. I think it would help too if we weren’t so isolated.

My family was a bit weary at the beginning as I wasn’t done school, but I finished before I gave birth and my family was happy about that. It sucks that they haven’t gotten to meet my son yet with covid, that breaks my heart.

Yeah I vomited a few times and I wanted to per all the time, my moth was very dry and I honestly wanted to take a shit as well.

They had removed all mirrors as well.

Sister and friends- uniformly kind and understanding

Colleague - initially kind but since our roles have brought us closer, politically and emotionally manipulative. She has also alluded to my experience in some meetings and fallen just shy of outing me as a CSA survivor.

Manager - this is the toughest one because he is a great guy. Kind, understanding, but I do also think he sees me as slightly less than my counterparts. I have noticed that he is indirect with feedback as if he thinks I am too fragile to take it when I prefer directness and brutal honesty. I also think there is a glass ceiling that he sees for me.

[],,paleislandhorse,,,[],,,,text,t2_536zitv2,False,False,[],"Life has never been that enjoyable for me personally. Sure, its had its moments, but generally not great. my childhood was probably the most joyful time of my life which i guess is probably the same for a lot of people, before the reality of the world puts its proverbial hands around your neck and slowly suffocates you as it looks you in the eyes with a smirk on its face watching you suffer and slowly slip away.   


But all romanticizing aside, ever since i started going to school its been a steady decline into perpetual depression and a general discontent toward not only myself, but also this world and this ever increasing feeling that i do not belong here.   


In school i didn't have a lot of friends, i mean yeah like i wont sit here and say that i didn't have any, because i did and honestly i still talk to a couple of them, but i have a feeling those relationships might be coming to an end, just a feeling. Otherwise yeah in school i never really felt ""accpeted"". I was a gifted musician in school and when people found out about that their attitudes toward me changed, they looked at me different, they even talked to me differently. That all felt weird. As if being able to do this thing gave me worth as a person or credibility. Don't get me wrong i enjoyed the change of scenery in terms of how they treated me, loved the new found respect people had for me, but again...it just felt weird to experience that.   


I learned pretty early on that i didn't really connect with most people, in fact i honestly felt like there was something wrong with me, still feel that way tbh.   


Hell even now, in this weird time for me, i feel ever so distant from everyone ive ever met or known and that includes me own parents, my dad specifically who i have always a good relationship with. It feels strange to acknowledge that because he was  basically the conductor of my whole childhood.   


He got me into film, comics, and was a big influence on where i went musically once i started doing it in a serious manor. My passion for creativity and artistic expression started with him in terms of what he exposed me too. But, at heart my dad is very much a blue collar man and theres nothing wrong with that its just who he is, but as i get older i find it increasingly hard to talk to him about things. I refuse to open up to much about my bouts of depression and my mental health and well being because i know he won't understand and even if he did he wouldnt know how to articulate it in a way that would help, and like again thats ok. He's my dad hes done enough for me through my entire life that i don't expect that of him. I just wish talking to him felt different.   


All it is these days is just me talking about things i enjoy that he doesnt understand so all i get from him is ""well all that matters is that you enjoy it"" or another staple of his is ""whatever makes you happy"" and like yeah maybe i sound like an ungrateful prick who doesnt appreciate the fact that i have a supportive father, but its all ive ever gotten from him are those pre rehearsed lines of support and endearment and i do appreciate that, but i guess what i miss is having a real conversation with someone.. It's why im on reddit so much is because its the only place i can go to have actual in depth conversations with people about whatever and just you know, talk.   


I'm in such a horrible place mentally because i just got out of a long term relationship. It ended poorly and involved me having developed feelings for another woman at the end which also ended poorly. By the end of it i was wrecked mentally and felt so unwanted and disregarded by them and when i came home that feeling was then amplified by the fact that no one acted like they really cared? Like actually showed that they cared. They may have said the same old lines ""well im here for you"" or ""you can talk to me"" but it was like no one ever reached out or stayed in contact with me or checked in on me. Maybe thats on me though, but i dont know. In January i felt so fucking alone and depressed, i would cry alone a lot and just generally felt like a piece of shit that no one actually cared about, at least not enough for anyone to reach out and make contact... Idk again maybe thats on me.   


As time has gone on i have improved mentally, at least i think i have. It could also be me slowly establishing a false reality that suits my standards so i can function in my day to day. But that aside i have actually come to enjoy aspects of the single life. I've had what i've kind of looked at as being a ""reawakening"" with film and music, lmao thats kind of cheesy, but it works and describes it accurately.   


I've been listening to so much music, just all the time, something i haven't heard or if it is something i've heard i'm listening to it more closely and with more attention. I've been finding new things to watch, films ive never seen, stuff ive never even heard of, but its so much fun because i'm watching things that are so intriguing and mesmerizing, like i've gained such a new appreciation for the art of film and storytelling.   


Over the past few months me and a long time friend who is also a musician wrote and are still writing an entire album of music, which i feel good about for sure, but i've had my doubts with that whole thing and him.   


He's very scatter brained and puts a lot of undue weight on his shoulders and as a result in my opinion it makes what we work on, suffer. Its not done, but hes grown more distant to it and i get a sense that maybe he's intimidated by the next step in the process which will be finishing these pieces of music, putting lyrical content to them and getting them exactly where we feel they should be.   


I'm not really voicing any of this to him personally because we're friends and i have a lot of respect for the guy so i won't burden him with these concerns, in my mind im just like ""let the guy do what he feels he gotta do"" but its a complex in my brain because i care about the art and want it done right and just want it done period. We've had similar complications in the past which is why i feel my concerns are valid.   


It's makes me want to do stuff on my own, like solo stuff i guess. Just for the sake of having complete and unbridled creative control over what i'm doing. But i'm so unstable mentally that when i'm alone trying to write and be creative i can't find a path or a direction, like the creativity isnt there in the way i feel it should be. I lack confidence in myself and i feel like im not good enough, which is another thing like i feel like wanting to do music as a career is such an unachievable dream that im setting myself up for a life of disappointment, which adds to my already debilitated mental state.   


It makes me hate myself... because im so fucked up and i can't fix it.

Like say I want to install an outdoor tv antenna, hang a picture, put in a garbage disposal, etc. Living in an apartment it's always a stressor to me that I might do damage to something, and always a frustration when I can't do a project I think is interesting or useful.

Another issue is space-- I went from a 600square foot apt for $700 a month to a 2000 sqr ft house for $800. 

Repairs are another issue. I lived in apartments where major issues developed (like no heat in a buffalo winter, no ac in a San Antonio summer) and the landlord dragged on fixing it. I had a broken window for my last year as a tenant because the landlord couldn't be bothered. 

The landlords dragged other things too-- packages too longer since they'd sit in the management office over a weekend, I went a month without health insurance because a landlord wouldn't give me the mailbox key.

For me it's kinda like if you were in a very realistic VR game, but it started to glitch slightly, not so much that it's immediately obvious (you're not hallucinating or anything), just enough that it feels a bit off and you're aware that it's not really real.

The background looks slightly 2d, like in movies when you can't tell if the setting is really or a greenscreen. Some things stick out more than others, like they were photoshopped over the top of original background.

Everything looks subtly bigger/smaller or subtly deformed (1mm diffrence to what it ""should"" look like), or even as if it very subtly changes size/shape when you look away.

Deciding to do something lags behind actually doing something, like when you touch something hot and instinctively move your hand away before you actually feel the pain. Processing input lags too, you understand what someone is saying a split second after they say it (so, if someone is talking, you're currently understanding the last word they said, not the one they're currently saying) .

Doing things feels like you only imagined doing them. Like, you find yourself in the kitchen drinking water and you're like ""how the fuck did I get here, I was in the living room a second ago"". You remember walking there and pouring yourself some water, but you didn't realise you actually did it IRL, you though you just planned to.

By that, I mean that I realized my lie was not going to benefit me, but if I were to come clean it wouldn’t make sense why I decided to lie in the first place. Basically, to not have the lie backfire in my face I had to build on the lie, make the person angrier with me, go through about 2 weeks of having to re-explain my fabricated thought process of why I did that thing and then continue to live with the consequences. 

The story behind that is I originally made up the lie I assume to make my day more interesting, and I made up a story of smoking weed with a guy that fancied me. Boyfriend at the time of course got pissed. I don’t know if this was the best cover up, but I also don’t think I lie with much thought. I’ve never gotten caught in a huge lie because the biggest lies for me have been about things that people don’t usually lie about I guess, or don’t have reasons to lie about. 

I got diagnosed about a year ago though by multiple psychiatrists and psychologists after feeling badly and deciding that my lies were interfering with my own perception of myself. I think it’s caused my to question whether anything I immediately think, do, say, or feel is a lie and that’s been the most detrimental and confusing part of this whole thing. I know at some point I chose to start lying and then continued to decide to not stop, but I’m still in the process for remedying these habits.

It’s like I understood a few things I got these “ahhha that’s why” feelings. Sadly most of it is kind of forgotten now. I moved fast from one thought to another. The music had a very big effect on me, it changed my mood a lot. 
Last wave hit me hard and was the most intense one. Now everything was 3D kind of very sharpened. The head of the male psychologist became a chimpanzee head. I saw some whirls just in the middle of nowhere. I wanted to pee very badly so we went to the bathroom but I was so extremely tired. I didn’t feel good. I had just before looked at my hand and it looked weird, I saw the veins and flesh. Then my hand brcame black and filled with acne sort of like a demon hand so I quickly closed my eyes. 
Walking to the bathroom I had my eyes closed and she guided me trough the hall in the hospital. I felt so tired and had a lot of anxiety and eventually I just passed out in the middle of the hall. I remember calling the other one to quickly come and then I was as if the room faded up in smoke. It all became pitch black, like a black eternity and I was in it, not my physical body.  Dark and warm eternity. I didn’t remember anything, I didn’t remember my life or me, It was as if I had never been born. Suddenly I was SOMEWHERE RLSE. I can’t deceive it and I don’t remember that place now just as THEN when I was THERE I didn’t remember me or life on earth. I was happy there. I woke up to her slapping my face. I didn’t remember my name or what or who I was. I didn’t know what she was. I felt like a computer loading all its programs. I knew nothing, it was the first time I saw a human, the first time experiencing the physical world. I was rebooted. Then I passed out again apparently but I dont remember.  I was carried to bed and that last part was very unpleasant. I drifted in and out of consciousness, I had so much anxiety and I was afraid. Everything was distorted and crisp at the same time, sort of inverted. My legs felt weird. Then the high wire off pretty quickly after about 30 mins and I was done. I was finally back.

We basically all just were scattered across the room moaning for help. Time went by very slow and we all had extreme anxiety. 

This was my first time with shroom (and last I tell you that.) and I have never experienced something like this. 
But mind you since the study means 30 people, 15 get the real deal and 15 get a man made placebo with similar high (so that you won’t tell the difference). Nobody knows, no even the doctors who took the real psilocybin. The actual study is the after effects since it’s said to change the person to less negative affective aka depressed. A person who has done shrooms typically make big changes with their lives, stop drug abuse, have more positive outlook and much less anxiety. This is what they will measure in all participant and if psilocybin works, major changes will be shown in those who took the real deal. 

The dose is equally much for everyone and I’m a small young female. I don’t have any persisting visuals luckily, but it feels like I’ve put on some awkward glasses. My motor function is a bit weird and awkward, and I feel surreal at times which gives me great anxiety. 

It came in waves. I was very nervous first and after 90 minutes they asked me to tell how psychedelic my experience was from 1-10. I said 3. 
I feel like I had about 7-10 waves during the trip. It’s like you get very high and then less high and sort land for a while. With every wave it became more intense. At first I was very sad and cryin in foster position, talking about a heartbreak that truly ruined me (it’s the reason why I’m doing this study). I felt so much grief (I do feel this grief almost daily even though 1.5 years passed) and it was as if I went back to some child state. One of the psychologists sat beside me in the bed and stroked my hair and told me it was going to b alright.  After a while I stopped. I was encouraged to keep the headphones on and the eye covers. I had not opened my eyes yet but I sort of felt the visuals, like when you’ve looked at an image and then close your eyes and they’re still sort of there, a reminder of the picture. I felt sick and puked a few times but nothing came up, and then I was good right after puking. I felt anxiety at times but not so much. I then took the eyefold off but had my eyes closed and I felt like I saw a huge lotus flower opening up and it was so bright and white in the middle, felt like a source or a core of some sort. It was mostly pretty chill and I started to laugh a lot. I couldn’t stop laughing. I was staring in to the lamp and the crystals I had put on the table beside me and I just laughed and cried from happiness, it was so wonderful. Mind you I have very bad eyesight and I see very blurry without glasses but it was still wonderful and things didn’t feel so blurry to me.  I saw prisms, rainbrows, everything was shimmering and glowing as if I was in a crystal cave. Magical.

A billionaire (thinking about the big Pharamaceutical, Energy, and Tech billionaires here) will often be paying their employees an above-average wage. Despite paying decent wages and incurring those expenses, investors basically think their company is so god damn hot they throw money at the billionaire. Billionaires are created from crazy inflated stock, not from amazing balance sheets that don't consider stock. 

The company isn't actively making someone poor, these hot billionaire companies are usually paying their employees a fair/above average wage. If the company was actively paying wages BELOW average vs another competitor, they'd be called out since they have so many eyes on them.

The closest you could get is blaming an investor for putting their money into the hot company rather than putting their money into poor communities, but you can really blame them?

I of course don't know anything about these things, but if you wanted to tell me a little bit about it, I'd be curious to listen :)

Do you stream or youtube? You could play and stream for fun. Today I've met a street performer with some kind of interesting drum, we talked a bunch, he was pretty cool. I know it's random but you could perform on the street as a busker if you felt like it, it feels good to spread good vibes to people by playing a special instrument I bet.  


I'm really happy to hear that you know what brings you joy in life. You should dedicate some time to all those things so that you're happier overall, I think, but maybe you already do so maybe I should mind my own business xD

In the initial moments there would unfortunately be little we could due to keep a toddler from running back inside. Neighbors would hopefully step up if they were around or awake. A house fire generally will have fire, EMS, and law enforcement all sent to the scene. Whoever arrives first would certainly stop a toddler from running back in. If a firefighter had to be dedicated for a short time with the toddler until law enforcement or family arrived, we would do that. While we are trying to put out a fire, human life takes priority over property so we will do what needs to be done to keep the toddler safe. I can’t speak for what would come after the fire. That would be a law enforcement issue. I would assume they would find family or child protective services if no family afterwards. 
Red Cross has an amazing response to fires for families. They will usually be notified of the ages and genders of displaced people and out together a small wardrobe and temporary living arrangements for immediately after the fire if the family has no place to go.

Question | Answer | Link
---------|----------|----------|
Congratz, if all goes well I plan on buying my first house at 54!|GO FOR IT!  I lived ONE month in an apartment. I swore never again, and I never did.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1yugl/today_i_made_the_final_mortgage_payment_on_my/gwga8sm/)
Congratulations on you accomplishment! I’d like to know if it was a good investment when all is said and done. Was it worth it, financially?|Oh my yes. The peace of mind. I never neglected any work that had to be done, no matter how minor. A 500$ job can become $5000 very quickly, so theres no huge upkeep at this time.  Now I can relax financially for the last half of my life. And don't forget,,  if I have to sell, I don't lose some of that money to the bank.  I know I'll always have a home. I can make any adjustment to suit my needs. My credit rating is through the roof  and my bank loves me. 😁|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1yugl/today_i_made_the_final_mortgage_payment_on_my/gwgrr5t/)
Congratulations! What are your plans now?|Oh my. Well theres a bit of work to be done on my home, usual upkeep stuff. I want a larger monitor for my computer ,need it until I can get eye surgery done, and I WANT A FREAKING RECLINER CHAIR! A GOOD ONE! Also a new sofa. *sigh*  Of course I'll save as much as I can and hopefully in a few years  I'll take that trip I've always dreamt of to England and Ireland .|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1yugl/today_i_made_the_final_mortgage_payment_on_my/gwgerm9/)
How long have I hated you because I’m very jealous of your achievement?|Dont be. Keep your goal in mind, never kid yourself-it will take a long time but day by day you will get there, work with your bank! Do NOT avoid debt-face it head on!  If you have any q's, I'm willing to answer them if I can ❤|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1yugl/today_i_made_the_final_mortgage_payment_on_my/gwgmqmx/)
Happy 4 U|Thanks!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1yugl/today_i_made_the_final_mortgage_payment_on_my/gwg5nnf/)
Congratulations! We’re about to make our first mortgage payment, and if all goes well it’ll be paid off around 50-55 as well!|CONGRSTULATIONS!  Dont think of it as if all goes well. Think of it as I will always do what I can and I will work with my bank.  If you do not acknowledge the road is rocky you will trip and fall. If you keep a watchful eye out for the rocks,  you can navigate around them. ( stay on top of repairs and upkeep  and dont ignore the big repairs. They will happen. Dont let them scare you. Solve one tiny problem as it happens or they will pile up into one huge problem.)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1yugl/today_i_made_the_final_mortgage_payment_on_my/gwhmmc8/)
I'm 22 and just made my first mortgage payment, (literally a couple hours ago lol) anything that I'm about to be potentially blindsided by?  Maybe something you didn't realize before buying?  Congrats btw :)|And congrats to you!  The only thing I could think of that might have changed my mind was that damn Walmart thst went up 4 years ago 3 blocks away. THAT would have stopped me from buying the house i did. But it didnt and while I'd rather a quieter place, like it started,  I'm ok with it.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1yugl/today_i_made_the_final_mortgage_payment_on_my/gwhubll/)
Congrats! Did you have a disciplined plan on paying it off? Or was it just time?|Both. Because of my financial circumstances, I stayed on monthly payments. I knew I could always make that monthly payment, but I couldnt make that promise with biweekly payments. Stick with what you know you can handle.  Need more money? Get another job. Cut back. Do not avoid debtors! Work with them!  Dont be afraid to ask about negotiating for better rates, but do not think you know everything either. This is why mortgage advisors are trained.  If you do not trust your advisor, GET ANOTHER ONE! You do not have to stick with one because they were assigned to you!  Most important of all, stay true to your goals! If you want to own your home outright, stop moving around! Pick a home and go for that one.  I've cut my monthly costs by 40% and Im nowhere close to retirement! THE FREEDOM!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1yugl/today_i_made_the_final_mortgage_payment_on_my/gwgkzoi/)
Congratulations|Thanks!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1yugl/today_i_made_the_final_mortgage_payment_on_my/gwg7h02/)
I am 38 and only 7 years left on my mortgage.  I can't wait.  It's not a huge house, but it's almost all mine!|Mine isnt big either! 1000 finished sq ft living space,  unfinished basement and attic, and I love it! Congrats! Dont rush it unless you're absolutely sure. Remember 7 years of definite payments always beats ""maybe"" payments.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1yugl/today_i_made_the_final_mortgage_payment_on_my/gwhtj62/)
I’m shopping for a house literally right now. What advice would you give to someone just getting into their first owned home?|First, dont think about moving in 3-5 years. If it happens it happens. Look for a home you WANT to live in. Second do NOT kid yourself when it comes to upkeep. You will need steady income and the desire to stay on top of things. My neighbour had a 500$repair job on her garage roof 8 years ago, but she wanted to spend the money on sod. Her garage is now being demolished by the city st her expense. That's how fast it happens. 3rd, check out the neighborhood at key times, Friday nights, Saturday nights, holiday weekends if possible. Be sure they dont turn into assholes when the weekend hits.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1yugl/today_i_made_the_final_mortgage_payment_on_my/gwi2r6f/)
Is it worth it? To struggle 20 years with 2 and 4 jobs just be a home owner for maybe another 20 when you're old and can't do much?|LOL I didnt ignore any of the upkeep. I dont have children but i have family, none were neglected. I was my mothers primary caregiver for 7 years. I went on dates, hung out with friends  had food on the table, clothes on my back. now at 54, I only have one job, 35 hrs per week (14 years now)  almost half my earnings will go into the bank for the day I retire. I have a roof over my head, I have reliable workers I trust to work on my home  I live in a pleasant community.   Yes. I KNOW it was worth it. Too many people buy a house, call it a home, then for 5 years do nothing but the bare upkeep. Sell it ""as is"", passing their neglected problems to someone else and start over.  To me, THAT isnt worth the struggle.  ""If you're not willing to do the work, then dont take the job.""|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1yugl/today_i_made_the_final_mortgage_payment_on_my/gwgqvv0/)
What’s the value of your house today?|Estimate set at 150k|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1yugl/today_i_made_the_final_mortgage_payment_on_my/gwg6l67/)
Among paying your home off, did you invest anywhere else?|No. When it comes to money, I'm not a risk taker. I've seen how it can destroy people.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1yugl/today_i_made_the_final_mortgage_payment_on_my/gwhihe8/)
what’s a piece of financial advice you wish you had known when you were younger?|LMAO! DONT OVER SPEND ON AUCTIONS, ESPECIALLY EBAY!!!!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1yugl/today_i_made_the_final_mortgage_payment_on_my/gwhiwwm/)
Have you ever tried skydiving?|No but I would LOVE to!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1yugl/today_i_made_the_final_mortgage_payment_on_my/gwhkmfr/)
What do you do for work?|Whe I had 4 jobs I worked in a bingo hall as seller/cleaner, a ticket seller in another hall, sold Avon (average 124 customers) and inserted flyers into papers. When I had 2 jobs, for 10 years I worked in market research part time and delivered daily newspapers by bike.  The market research job got better, I quit the paper job. Been an interviewer 14 years now.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1yugl/today_i_made_the_final_mortgage_payment_on_my/gwhm3ka/)
Do you get people who have no interest in ever owning a house and renting for life?|Sure I do. A house isnt for everyone. I love fixing things, refinishing wood,  being responsible.  And some people prefer having their home taken card of by someone else.  I take care of myself. To each their own.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1yugl/today_i_made_the_final_mortgage_payment_on_my/gwhoiuw/)
If you could offer 1 or if I could be so bold, 3 pieces of advice to a younger person looking to buy their first home what would it be?|1. Be realistic! If you cannot afford a house over $150k, then dont buy one for more than $150k 2- buy for the long term. Dont move every 3-5 years . That's not a house! It's an expensive apartment! 3- stay on top of repairs, and upkeep. If your roof needs reshingling, but you'd love that new deck, get the damn roof fixed! A $5000 reshingling job will save you a $20k roof rebuild 4- find good reliable work people for all areas, plumbing  handyman, electrical and  so forth. Talk to people. Get names. Take pics of business cards, facebook pages etc. Keep it all together. When you need someone  you'll have a place to start your search. 5- if you fall behind on payments CONTACT YOUR BANK BEFORE IT HAPPENS! work with them, not against them!  Hope this helps|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1yugl/today_i_made_the_final_mortgage_payment_on_my/gwhopsv/)
Congratulations!|Thank you!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1yugl/today_i_made_the_final_mortgage_payment_on_my/gwhr7bh/)

I can only work four hour shifts or my body starts to literally paralyze/spazz out if I go any longer. I have had to have IV fluids for low potassium, my heart rate is only 52 at rest and my blood pressure is always around 80/60. I would say this eating disorder has caused my life to be a constant struggle. It all started from me being molested by my grandfather when I was younger, and not having any control of what was going on, so I turned to the one thing I can control at that time which was my eating. When I wasn’t being molested anymore, it got a little bit better and I was able to eat again, but then my boyfriend cheated on me with three different girls so again, I started to “diet” which turned into a mind of its own. I dropped 40 lbs in one month and had to go to an inpatient facility after being orthostatic.

3- stay on top of repairs, and upkeep. If your roof needs reshingling, but you'd love that new deck, get the damn roof fixed! A $5000 reshingling job will save you a $20k roof rebuild
4- find good reliable work people for all areas, plumbing  handyman, electrical and  so forth. Talk to people. Get names. Take pics of business cards, facebook pages etc. Keep it all together. When you need someone  you'll have a place to start your search.

---------|----------|----------|
What’s the weirdest request you’ve gotten?|Oh gosh well any involving blood and scat are always the ones that stick out to me as definitely not my thing.  Not a request but weirdest thing is that there's this one guy who doesn't speak at all but says ""Mommy Milky"" tips 10 dollars every single day at the same. It's been like 3 months and I think he's missed only like 4 or 5 days. Genuinely baffling haha xoxo|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n232aj/i_22f_am_in_the_top_08_of_onlyfans_content/gwgwimp/)
What kind of content do you have on your onlyfans?  How much do you charge a month?  Is everything included in the month price?|I want to say good content haha  If you follow any of my links or search me it'll tell you that it's $25 per month.  Everything is not. I do not have the winning lotto numbers unfortunately xoxo|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n232aj/i_22f_am_in_the_top_08_of_onlyfans_content/gwgwg05/)
How many times have you been offered money for sex? What’s the most somebody has offered?|Many times and there have been crazy offers in the millions that I don't believe. One offer from a guy who confirmed that he actually could pay it was €50k so I'll say that one is the most xoxo|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n232aj/i_22f_am_in_the_top_08_of_onlyfans_content/gwgwlh2/)
Have you ever received any offers to work for major company’s/studios?|Ooo good question. Several offers from minor ones but only 2 genuine offers from places I would consider ""major"".|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n232aj/i_22f_am_in_the_top_08_of_onlyfans_content/gwgxyjg/)
What’s your most popular video on your only fans?|Hard to know, a lot of the videos that go over best are customs I've made for individual fans. I think my content in natural sunlight does really well! xoxo|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n232aj/i_22f_am_in_the_top_08_of_onlyfans_content/gwgy2x5/)
How long do you plan on doing the onlyfans thing?  Do you want to do something else?|I have a full time career which I absolutely adore. Went to college for it etc so I don't see myself giving that up even with Onlyfans doing so well.  I plan on doing online content for at least another 5 years whether that be specifically on Onlyfans, I don't know. xoxo|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n232aj/i_22f_am_in_the_top_08_of_onlyfans_content/gwgyf4r/)
Are you in a relationship? If so does your significant other support your decision to do onlyfans?|Nope, I'm not. xoxo|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n232aj/i_22f_am_in_the_top_08_of_onlyfans_content/gwgz313/)
Do your friends and family know your on onlyfans? If so how do they react?|Family, no. Friends, very few but the ones who do know are supportive xoxo|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n232aj/i_22f_am_in_the_top_08_of_onlyfans_content/gwgzc3j/)
It seems like most of your bras are small and are barely containing your boobs. Are your boobs still growing?|Absolutely haha xoxo|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n232aj/i_22f_am_in_the_top_08_of_onlyfans_content/gwgzq50/)
What size are your boobs?  Are they real?|Haven't been measured since prior to lockdown but I wear a 34GG.  Yup xoxo|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n232aj/i_22f_am_in_the_top_08_of_onlyfans_content/gwgwavb/)
Why do you think people pay for only fans when we have free porn in this modern age|Many reasons but I imagine it's the individualism of the site. It's akin to a virtual strip club in which, for money, you can ask for a personal lap dance that only you see. Why do people pay for strip clubs when there's so much free porn online? I would say it's the connection they feel from a personalized experience tailored (or taylored haha) to them and Onlyfans offers that in spades xoxo|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n232aj/i_22f_am_in_the_top_08_of_onlyfans_content/gwh8ik7/)
What's your favorite movie ?|Ooo tough question there are a few, Mean Girls is a classic. There's a small indie film called Broken that has Cillian Murphy in that I love but hardly anyone has heard of it. xoxo|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n232aj/i_22f_am_in_the_top_08_of_onlyfans_content/gwgwv2h/)
How long have you been on OnlyFans and how did you get the word out about it?|I think it's said in my post that I started in August 2020 so around 9 months ago. I get the word out primarily through Twitter and Reddit. xoxo|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n232aj/i_22f_am_in_the_top_08_of_onlyfans_content/gwgzeuz/)
Are you a foot model?|My boobs are definitely my biggest draw but I have done feet content xoxo|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n232aj/i_22f_am_in_the_top_08_of_onlyfans_content/gwgzvqr/)
Are you also in the top 0.8% in general or just on that website?|What does Top 0.8% in general mean? xoxo|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n232aj/i_22f_am_in_the_top_08_of_onlyfans_content/gwh1g8j/)
What has been the best and worst things about having an Onlyfans?|Best: increased confidence in my own sexuality. I wasn't the biggest fan of my body prior to Onlyfans and it's been a huge boost in my confidence!  Worst: Death threats and constant unsolicited dick pics aren't the best but I really don't like complaining xoxo|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n232aj/i_22f_am_in_the_top_08_of_onlyfans_content/gwh6ez2/)
What made you start? Had you been producing content before onlyfans?|Quite a long story but basically a friend had a sugar daddy in college. I then tried out a site called Seeking Arrangements back in 2019, didn't like it and then found a site called Hepays which was a findom site. Became the biggest Irish creator on there in 2019 but unfortunately the site shut down in May 2020. I migrated over to Twitter and then started OF in August. Rest is history xoxo|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n232aj/i_22f_am_in_the_top_08_of_onlyfans_content/gwh8rbs/)
Where did you develop the confidence to produce content?|A multitude of different places but I started the gym when I was 17 after having pretty major body confidence issues and that was a turning point in my confidence xoxo|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n232aj/i_22f_am_in_the_top_08_of_onlyfans_content/gwha5ly/)
How do you deal with mean online comments and people who stigmatize your work?|Well blocking people isn't hard haha, truthfully I feel like I haven't had any truly bad experiences with stigmatisation when compared to other SWers. I'm mainly content at the moment to block/ignore whenever it does happen xoxo|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n232aj/i_22f_am_in_the_top_08_of_onlyfans_content/gwhaqm2/)

Question | Answer | Link
---------|----------|----------|
Is it true that when you guys wreck your super cars you just toss them away and buy an new one?|No, if it can be fixed, we fix it. If it is severe wreckage we give away the car for free so that they can take out parts that are still usable and purchase a new car. Although this only happened with my brother but we apply this same rule if it happened to any of us.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n26tcy/i_am_the_son_of_an_arab_billionaire_i_am_18_years/gwhk2dp/)
Can we have gas under $2/gal please?|Haha, on a real note, it's crazy how gas is so expensive outside the Middle East. To this day it blows my mind.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n26tcy/i_am_the_son_of_an_arab_billionaire_i_am_18_years/gwhln45/)
What do you plan to do with your life? Are you going to go off on your own and pave your own way or live off the family wealth (I know that sound like I’m being an ass but it’s a legit question that probably would come across better in person than typed out on Reddit lol).|I completely understand what you mean and don't worry I did not take it that way. To answer your question, Yes, I will go off on my own and pave my own way for life and make my own money. This is a decision I have made that I personally want to take. I want to try it out for myself and see where I can get it. If I end up struggling and not really able to adapt to a different lifestyle I have not been used to, I will probably use my wealth to help me make a business to then generate my own income. You might also ask, ""You do not even need to work, You have enough money already"". I hate feeling like I am being a leach and not working for the things I want. I was raised that way and religion played a big role in this. I want to make something of myself, not to prove to anyone but to have something to be proud of. Right now I am going to move to California for university and start this vision I have for my life.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n26tcy/i_am_the_son_of_an_arab_billionaire_i_am_18_years/gwhkwee/)
Do you like rock and roll|No, not because I do not like it. I just never listened to it. Although I enjoy a whole lot of other genres. If you had my playlist, I would be the one with the AUX-in the group.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n26tcy/i_am_the_son_of_an_arab_billionaire_i_am_18_years/gwhm760/)
What are your career plans?  What business is your father in?|My career plans are not so clear at the moment, My major is computer science though. I still do not know which field in that major I want to pursue. I am doing my research though. My vision is to own a business that benefits society with something new to the world.  My father is in the oil industry, won't get too deep about it but he has a great position that was passed down on to him from my grandfather.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n26tcy/i_am_the_son_of_an_arab_billionaire_i_am_18_years/gwhmldw/)
Do you have plans to stay in your country, or would you like to move to a different country for a few years as opposed to just visiting?|I already am moving to the States, and see where I can get to on my own. Once I get my degree I will probably stay there or if I change my mind, move to Spain or Lebanon.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n26tcy/i_am_the_son_of_an_arab_billionaire_i_am_18_years/gwhon7e/)
How is your physical/mental health? What do you do for fun?|My physical and mental health, alhamdulillah is very good. I work out and been athletic since a young age. My mental health is very good because I have a loving family who takes care of each other no matter what. For fun, I usually go on yacht trips, or jet ski with friends, or even take mini-vacations to places we always wanted to go. Maybe even a traveling spree, see to what extent we can get to in a short amount of time. I like to throw house parties too.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n26tcy/i_am_the_son_of_an_arab_billionaire_i_am_18_years/gwhpp8c/)
Can you imagine not having enough food or a place to live or getting medical care?|No, I cannot process that. Although I have seen the lows of life, I have traveled around the world to help kids in need and see how other people around the world really live. If you are curious as to which parts, the poor parts of the earth. Ethiopia and Sierra Leone were the most eye-opening trips I have ever taken in my life.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n26tcy/i_am_the_son_of_an_arab_billionaire_i_am_18_years/gwhr04w/)
Do you or any of your rich family/friends have exotic pets? Have you ever hosted a party where you flew out Instagram models from around the world or have you ever gone to a party where you’ve seen those types of people at?|We do have exotic pets. Tigers, Lions, Chimpanzees, and Reptiles. I have hosted a party where I flew out models, but my parents do not know about this. I also have gone to parties where I have seen those types of people. Cannot lie, lots of fun.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n26tcy/i_am_the_son_of_an_arab_billionaire_i_am_18_years/gwhrbt8/)
What does a typical day in your life look like?|I usually wake up between 8 - 9 AM. Take a shower and go downstairs for breakfast. We have a chef who cooks are our meals so I never usually wait for breakfast to be ready. After I am done eating it would be 11 AM, where I go for football practice that lasts from 12 PM to 3 PM. I return back home take a shower again and probably make plans with friends for the rest of the day. That would be a typical day with no occasions or events of any sort. Although this happens only 2 days of the week as we always have things to do like sports, events, parties, and whatnot.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n26tcy/i_am_the_son_of_an_arab_billionaire_i_am_18_years/gwhkby2/)
Do you wanna go to college and get a job (if you’re not already doing those two) or would you just wanna live off your dads money? Sorry if it seems a bit assholey I’m just curious|Haha, No worries. I think I already answered something close to this if you look up top. I don't know how to use Reddit fully but I really enjoy Reddit.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n26tcy/i_am_the_son_of_an_arab_billionaire_i_am_18_years/gwho0g5/)
Where are you from ? and is it true that royals and rich arabs abuse the people who work under them ?|I am from Lebanon, but my mother is from Qatar. No, not all are this way. People do not have to be royals or rich to abuse people who work for them. Although there is a lot of wealthy families like this who do not appreciate the services provided by these people who are exactly the same as us. That is just disgusting and inhumane. We treat these people the same we would treat our brothers and sisters. With love and care. Look out for them and make sure they are in great health.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n26tcy/i_am_the_son_of_an_arab_billionaire_i_am_18_years/gwhpuch/)
How did your parents (and family) become so wealthy? Is it old money? New money? I’m curious.|My family have been apart of the oil industry for years now and the annual revenue of companies like this are in the billions. You could say both. It was not as near as it is today. You could say new money to make it fair.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n26tcy/i_am_the_son_of_an_arab_billionaire_i_am_18_years/gwhsg0c/)
Do women just throw themselves at ur and has your dad tried to have women marry you|I have had many women throw themselves at me but I kindly reject. My parents are not like that, their more open minded about subjects like these.

The best example is the commonly held belief that historically a 30 year old would be considered 'old' because of low average life expectancies. This is totally not true. Tones of people died under 5, literally tones. Despite this, if you made it past 5 you stood a fairly good chance of living to be much older. People reaching their 60s wasn't uncommon (depending on when we're talking about). Most people lived well past middle age, but lots of people dieing very young brings the average life expectancy down massively. For example the average (mean, what most people mean when they say average) of 5, 60, 60 and 60 is 46.25.

it fits any of the owning class. i know you won't have read any Marxist theory but i'll simplify it (not because i think you're incompetent, but because it is complicated). no matter how someone reaches the status of CEO (or something similar) at the end of the day, the position itself is exploitative. by becoming the owner of a business you must pay labourers less than what their work is worth for a profit. this must happen, otherwise there is no profit. therefore it is exploitative and the money that any ""CEO"" makes is not made through their own machinations in the world but by the working class whom they have employed. 

the only thing that the business owner, inherently, adds in this mode of production (capitalism) is the means of production. and they are never solely responsible for the creation of the means of production, rather they are a useless middle man stealing wealth in the form of profit. smaller business owners, perhaps yourself, are merely petite-bourgeoise whereas the people whom actually own the means of production are just bourgeoise.

I don't have any questions, I just want to say I'm really sorry you had to go through that and that I hope you're okay.|thank you :)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1i9u4/im_a_school_shooting_survivor_ama/gwdj98z/)
Which one were you involved in?|saugus high school|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1i9u4/im_a_school_shooting_survivor_ama/gwd6xhi/)
Did they ever catch the shooter?|he killed himself on site|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1i9u4/im_a_school_shooting_survivor_ama/gwd8l70/)
What do you think of the American education system?|i definitely think there needs to be focus more on mental health instead of just getting good grades and such. idk i feel like there’s a lot of issues that need to fixed but i cant rlly think of them rn. i might add on to this response later|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1i9u4/im_a_school_shooting_survivor_ama/gwd8uz9/)
What sort of kid was the shooter?|i didn’t know him personally but i know he was well liked and had a lot of friends. known to be a nice kid with good grades and on the track team and such|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1i9u4/im_a_school_shooting_survivor_ama/gwd9op1/)
have people ever used the shooting against you?|people have said stuff like “you should’ve got shot instead” if that’s what you’re asking, not sure if i understand the question|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1i9u4/im_a_school_shooting_survivor_ama/gwdb2pc/)
During the shooting, were students joking around or not taking lockdown seriously?  When I was in HS, I always thought there’d be a few idiots in my class who would be trying to make it a meme or something while everyone is trying to hide and stay quiet.  Also, glad you are okay and strong to post this AMA. Godspeed to you.|when we were hiding in the classroom i remember a couple kids laughing about it but they got shut down pretty fast by other students. other than that, everyone else near me was mature about it and took it seriously|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1i9u4/im_a_school_shooting_survivor_ama/gwdcd95/)
do you have survivors guilt?|no, i don’t think so. sometimes i feel guilty for not having survivors guilt tho|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1i9u4/im_a_school_shooting_survivor_ama/gwdjb4w/)
Did you know anyone that was hurt in the shooting and if so how did that affect you|the shooter was actually about 10 feet away from me and the victims were a friend group i sat next to everyday.  one of the victims was a close neighborhood friend of mine (she survived). when i heard she got shot i was in shock and i didn’t know how to react. when i found out she survived it was the biggest relief ever. i visited her and we talked for a bit and i feel like that gave me some closure.  another victim i spoke to a week before, interviewing him for a class but that was the only interaction i had with him (he passed away). his death hit me the hardest. i barely knew him but just having a voice memo of his interview really haunted me for a while.  i feel like having support from friends and family really helped me cope with it all|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1i9u4/im_a_school_shooting_survivor_ama/gwe06ms/)
What are your thoughts on gun control?|honestly, i just haven’t put much thought into this topic. i know gun control is an issue that needs to be solved but i would need to research more before forming an opinion on how to fix it or whatever|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1i9u4/im_a_school_shooting_survivor_ama/gwd79ud/)
What thoughts go through you when the shooting is happening? And how do you recover emotionally from that? I imagine there would be huge amounts of PTSD.|at first i thought it was a balloon popping. i know ppl are like “balloons sound nothing like guns wtf” but i have never heard a gunshot in real life and of course i’m going to assume it’s something innocent. when i looked up, i saw the terror in the faces of students and they started running and i was like wtf so it clicked in my head that it was shooting. i just dropped everything and ran to the nearest classroom, focused on getting to safety. as soon as i got to the classroom i just had a feeling that i was going to be okay? i’m not sure why but i knew i was coming out alive so i just focused on trying to calm down and text my parents. i was mostly worried about my friends and my brother. none of it really felt real at the time.  to recover, i spent a lot of time with loved ones and doing things i enjoy. i noticed that i kinda of turned to things that used to make me happy when i was little, like disney movies and playing roblox and such. the school provided me with a therapist for about 5 months and she helped a lot with talking me through my emotions. i still have bad ptsd but i try not to let it run my life i guess idk|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1i9u4/im_a_school_shooting_survivor_ama/gwd7emu/)
After finding out you were safe and it was over, what did you do first?  Also, was everyone immediately escorted out of the building to safety? Or were you allowed to go find your belongings before leaving?|they had us walk to a nearby park where i looked for my brother and waited for my grandma to pick me up. then we drove home and i just sat in my room.  after a while police came in and escorted everyone out with our hands up. some students already had their belongings so they took them along. i only had my water bottle but i did not bring it with because i was scared the police would think it’s a gun. a couple weeks later we were allowed back on campus to get our stuff|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n1i9u4/im_a_school_shooting_survivor_ama/gwetxgg/)

[],,Whomstvest,,,[],,,,text,t2_1da9v8qz,False,False,[],"Ah, you're talking about the exceedingly weird neopronouns, the ones that are usually based off of some concept either in real life or in fiction. Those fall under the same reasoning as normal neos, except that some have to do with a very new identification known as xenogenders. Explaining xenogenders is hard, especially for people who aren't ingrained in nonbinary discourse already, but I'll try my best. Xenogenders are an umbrella of genders which entail an individual attaching a concept to their gender, whether that be an animal, object, idea, fiction, or more. Two things to note about xenogenders.   
1. People who identify as a xenogender *don't think they're the concept itself.* This is the biggest thing people get wrong. If someone was catgender (you can guess what concept that's attached to), they'd only have cats be closely intertwined with their identity. They don't think they're a cat.  
2. Xenogenders are usually made for those with mental disorders such as autism or ADHD. Some people who have such things feel the need to attach themselves to concepts for a sense of comfort. Note that I said some, because as someone with ADHD I don't feel that need personally, and many others don't. 

Connotations include the stereotypical ""afab (assigned female at birth) who has their hair dyed and is vaguely androgynous"" idea people commonly have for people who are nonbinary, which some people don't want to be associated with. Also while they/them can and has historically been used to commonly refer to someone in the first person, some people still don't like it.

3. One thing I wish I would have been told is that you will have drugs shoved at you eventually-use your willpower- it’s not a clean business

For photo shoots, first pick an aesthetic that fits you and stick to it and decide what type of audience you plan to target.

1. aliexpress is a heaven sent for cheap clothes and lingerie just read the reviews first!
2. Props depend on your aesthetic but most common are pacifiers or for a darker vibe you could use knives. It all just depends.
3. Don’t worry too much about backgrounds since a bad background usually attracts more men? I guess it has a more personal vibe haha.
4. The most important part is going to be your clothing and the way you interact.
