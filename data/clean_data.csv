I was 19 and he was 27 and was incredibly charming, sweet and good-looking. He told me straight away what he did for a living and why he was there and asked if it was okay and surprisingly enough at the time, I was completely fine with it. He had another drink and then danced and talked all night. Around 4am he asked me to come to his room which I did and we had some of the most incredible and wild and animalistic and sweaty sex that you can possibly imagine. I stayed over until about 10 in the morning and then went back to my room. We exchanged instagrams and phone numbers and decided to keep in touch but I was certain we would never see each other again.

To my surprise, he texted me a few days later and we kept in touch for a few of months after which he invited me to come to Spain again and stay at his house. I planned a two week vacation and planned to go sight seeing but we ended up barely leaving the house and engaged in what can only be described as a non-stop, two week long fuckfest.

long story:

for reference, i've been clean for nearly 2.5 years now.

honestly i don't know what clicked for me. i was self-harming on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times a day. i was in therapy with a plethora of different therapists and i often ditched them after one or two visits because they all said the same generic shit that meant nothing.

if i had to say, it's not that i wanted to stop, because it helped me feel alive.

but i was hurting the people i loved. it wasn't just me. my mom, my friends, my sister, my ex at the time. every time i relapsed and came to them and they saw my wrists or my thighs or my arms or whatever, they would have the saddest look on their face. they never blamed me, but i couldn't keep seeing that sadness in their eyes. i realized i had to stop before it went too far and i couldn't ever keep my loved ones happy.

i have an app called ""I Am Sober"" (for all sorts of addictions) where you can log your feelings, how many days you've been clean, talk with other people who are in the same milestone ballpark as you, and a bunch of other stuff. it's helped a lot.

alongside making music, drawing art, going out and enjoying time with my sister, having virtual dates with my partner who lives 400+ miles away during a pandemic. it's the little things that remind me why i'm staying alive and staying clean.

The only times I think a union is helpful is if an employee is injured on the job, and the supervisor's are essentially strong-armed into treating the injured person like a baby.  This has disadvantages, too, however.  I saw an employee break a finger through their own fault, and they got put on extremely light duty for four months at UPS.  I've broken fingers playing sports and I returned in two weeks.


Also, remember that unions take a large chunk of money anyways.  I got paid more monthly at Amazon working for $16/hr compared to UPS paying $19/hr.  Considering the qualifications for working at Amazon, I think $16/hr starting pay is ridiculously generous.


I am in favor of unions for people that work full-time, but the majority of UPS and Amazon employees in the warehouse are part-time.  I don't want to see such a hefty union due if employees aren't even getting paid $50 a day because there simply isn't enough work to have them there more than two hours.

About a year ago, I was driving to visit my wife at the hospital one more time before she went to bed. I had been delayed and visiting hours were shorter due to COVID and I was in danger of missing the window entirely. I was speeding, driving over a bridge, downtown.  The gigantic police officer who pulled me over asked me where I was headed and I blurted out ""Sorry Officer, I'm going to visit my wife in palliative care at the hospital before visiting hours end.""

He took ID back to his car, came back about 2 min later and said ""I'm just going to give you a warning tonight. That rate of speed was dangerous. I'm sure your wife wouldn't want to get a ticket or worse, be in an accident. Take care.""

I think about that Police Officer's kindness a lot and ever since that day - I do not speed out of respect for him. Had I gotten the ticket, I'm sure I'd rationalize that I 'paid my debt' to society.

Of course, I just sulfured the migraine , and couldn't do much to mitigate same. My work nature was such , that I couldn't give myself any rest, nor did I know  any way to mitigate same. 

However, your eye twitching  is a pre-signal of the migraine. You should stop all activities if possible, sit calmly in a place and close your eyes. A darker place would be better or you can wear your eye band. Take some deep breathe and calm yourself down. This may take some 20 to 30 minutes for you to feel having regained your composure. Slowly come out of the process avoiding very bright light and giving your eyes to adjust again to the normal lighting condition.

Be aware also, This is nearly done on spot and at times you would have no option than to  carry your anti-migraine tablet and take it on getting the pre-signal or when the pain is already there or has become severe.

Migraine, actually indicates you need to pay attention to something related to your lifestyle, which the body is signaling to you.

For example, let's take the time I worked at UPS as a package loader (union).  Oftentimes the starting pay would be around $19.00 an hour.


Most employees get around 90 minutes of work each day, so we'll round up and say each employee is getting 8 hours a week, which means $152 a week.  Each week they would take off my hourly wage multiplied by 1.33 (I believe it was), so I'm getting paid closer to $125 a week.  The first paycheck of each month also takes off $50 for union dues, meaning that I'm losing about $75 of my paycheck because of union dues.


That is my main reason as a worker.  I was a part time supervisor at UPS, and during that time I saw that unions also protect employees that should've been let go a long time ago.  The most annoying one (and the reason I quit) was when a guy grabbed a woman's ass with a wide hand and squeezed it, and he was back within two weeks.

I think that two things can be true at once. There has undoubtedly been a massive increase in people identifying as trans within the past few years, but it honestly makes sense because of the increase of awareness and acceptance that's been going on. If I was born 10 years earlier, I probably would have either came out a lot later or committed suicide. 

However, when something becomes a hot topic, people like to jump on the bandwagon. I do think that some people, especially young girls, have confused other issues for gender dysphoria. Proper psychological examinations before making any medical decisions is important imo. I don't know if I think that *most* people are confused/faking it, but I think there are probably a large number of people that have got a bit muddled up and will hopefully figure themselves out later. 

Detransitioning (after starting medical transition) really isn't common in my country though. If you take the NHS route, you sit on a waiting list for years and go through psychological examinations before being given hormones/approved for surgeries. I was diagnosed with Transsexualism (ICD10 F64.0) before I was given testosterone (it's called gender incongruence in the newest version of the ICD I think).

The bruising was on my breasts. As a result, 4 days later, the police were called to force me to go home, because child abuse was unfounded. It was 2 new officers on the scene, and I tried to explain what had happened and volunteer for the pictures then, but they refused to listen to me. Instead, I did juvenile detention time for assaulting my stepmother, from when I punched her back in self-defense.

At 16, I was arrested again for shoplifting (one-time thing - I was a troubled kid but I’m better now), and I was interrogated by a female police officer, who told me she’d worked for my city for 10 years.

I’m a female, mid-20s, never orgasmed. I’m married and am my husband’s first sexual partner. I had sexual partner before him but never focused on trying to orgasm (he was selfish, I was naive). 

I’ve come what feels close to orgasming through oral and rubbing stimulation but have never been successful. I enjoy sex without orgasming, but I know I’m missing something, which I believe is affecting my sex drive. How can I come to orgasm?

I know the typical suggestion is to learn my body and what I like, but truthfully I find it difficult to stay aroused while masturbating. I get too in my head/discouraged I think to continue. It feels embarrassing to not know what my own body wants as an adult.

I always say there's a difference between knowledge and wisdom. People are encouraged to gain all kinds of knowledge in Islam but aren't learning the wisdom behind things. Like we memorize verses and teach kids to memorize them but sometimes fail to understand the meaning and the purpose behind these ayat, so we're essentially becoming parrots who just repeat.

And like what you mentioned things about manners. There tends to be people who even though they are praying 5 times, fasting and doing whatever we should be doing, but still have rude attitudes and our character is not matching Islam and doesn't resemble the character of the prophets. Since the prophet muhammad. alayhi salaat wa salaam, said ""whoever is better in manners is better in religion"", it seems to be a big issue that we need to address more.

I think when there are muslims who are only muslim by name see the muslim who does practice certain things but is rude or judgemental it can be very discouraging for them to want to have Islam in their lives more. We are not The Most Just of Judges, and if we were given other peoples lives we may have made worse decisions with them.

I really like your point on discussions with peoples concerns or fears in religion especially young people. We should be more open to controversial subjects, that's the only way we'll understand how to get through them. Also certain subjects in Islam that seem controversial when you are uninformed, but once you do become informed are not controversial at all. Let's talk about the hard things and not shy away from them.

No matter how much I tried I couldn’t sleep but I was way to tired to do anything so I just had to lay there for what felt like days because I was so out of it. Anytime  someone tried to talk to me I was confused and disoriented. But then when I finally got to sleep I slept for 21 hours straight. But for the next two days I’m was still extremely tired but able to make it through the day. 

Another consequence is I throw up, which I hate. 
I have a tic that stops me from breathing for a period of time and after it was over I threw up so much. It was terrible.

When I have a paralysis tic my body is constantly going limp, then I get back up, then I’m back down. So my head is moving quite fast in a short period of time which makes me extremely sick.

Women orgasm from clitoral stimulation. Most women only from clitoral stimulation. It has the most nerves and is the most sensitive part of her body. Look up a picture of the clitoris — the pea-sized “button” people talk about is just a fraction of the clitoris, it is a larger element than people realize.

This means that penetrative sex needs to also stimulate her, potentially with fingers or a toy that is curved. Women orgasm from clitoral stimulation the most, then vaginal penetration, then anal penetration. Some women report orgasm from breast stimulation alone. 

It can seem like men need to get their partners off with their penis, but that’s a stereotype about masculinity and misinformation about how sex works for people. 

Using your hands while penetrating is like frying and egg in one pan with one hand and writing down a manifesto in the other. It’s really hard to do both of those things at once — the clitoral stimulation will be less orgasmic. You might try having her hold a vibratos while you penetrate her — that’s considered the holy grail of achieving mutual orgasm.

I will say to you, good sir, if you are making a girl orgasm from oral sex, you are doing it right and you are a stand out from the crowd.

1) The female orgasm is incredibly powerful and quite literally exhausting. It is more powerful and longer lasting than the male orgasm, so exhaustion makes a lot of sense. You can also enjoy g-spot arousal without orgasming from it. Or potentially g-spot stimulation combined with someone else. All of that is normal and depends on the person. Some people find clitoral stimulation their best route to orgasm, but how intense their clit feels arousal will vary. That’s why some girls cannot do vibrators and others love them.

2) What kind of porn does your partner watch and why does it make you somewhat uncomfy? If you are uncomfortable with the kind of porn he likes, definitely talk it through. If you are insecure about your body from the women of porn (this is the most likely from our research, although not always true!), then definitely work through that. If your partner is using porn to replace you, then that’s an issue to take to a therapist together....or if he has a porn addiction as you can see. 

When people watch porn, it isn’t cheating and it is healthy and normal as long as in moderation and not with content that disturbs one or the other partner. Your partner probably has used porn more regularly for sex than other things.

That is a really good question! And one that I have thought about and discussed a lot with my family 

So here's my take on it, I think that we should try to focus on the principles of Islam rather than the minor details that a lot of Sheikhs and Muslims seem to be focusing on today, so we should be more concerned with community support and giving out Zaka and Sadaqat and finding ways to help others rather than focus on what women should be wearing or what medicines break the fast, even though those issues are important, they shouldn't be the main focus

We should be looking into leading with our behavior and mannerism, to let our Islam show through our good actions and forgiveness and tolerance, to read Quran and try to understand it every time, not just read it to increase the number of times you finished reading it. 

To allow discussions regarding religion, especially with young people, let them speak out their fears and concerns and insecurities about religion, and help them understand them and overcome them rather than shut them down and saying that's Haram you shouldn't say that

And you know humans might not have gender roles as prominent so there’s little you can do as male which you can’t do as female after all. And not to be blunt, but except visuals and maybe sexism there’s nothing one can’t do that isn’t related to 18+ stuff.

I on the other hand am forced to live whole wrong live from the very beginning and trust me when I say it’s not fun. Tried to kill myself twice, 3rd one is coming soon and the help I get is non-existent, and of course you know persecution here is even worse than transgender people have ever experienced. 

So you know lots and lots of issues.

I’m a 40 yo woman who is happily married to a man. My sex drive has been low for years and it worries me. When I was younger (teens through young adulthood probably into around 25-30 ish) my drive was stronger. I would be around a partner and feel horny and things would progress. 

Now (since about my early to mid 30’s) it’s different. I am able to experience arousal with my husband and come to orgasm by him or when I masturbate but my overall drive is very low and I am never “in the mood”. 

Basically I can be worked up and we’ve worked together to find out what works for me and what brings me to arousal but it’s a bit of a job and can feel like a chore that needs to get started. Once I’m aroused I have a great time. 

Is it normal to not feel the impulse to get started? I want it for myself but also because I love my husband and want to bring him joy too. The fact that it takes work even to feel arousal to begin things means that I am never in the mood and we have sex less frequently or spontaneously.

It doesn't serve the same purpose for women, in the case of women it would only be about lust as having more than one partner serves no other purpose. 

But you should know that there are conditions for having more than one wife, they must treat them equally when it comes to spending and responsibility as well as spending time with them, otherwise they might be committing injustice which god warns about in the Quran and that it will have its own punishment

So it might be considered a perk, but it's also a big responsibility, that unfortunately some men aren't taking seriously

In the current political climate, do you feel this has caused a decline in overly qualified applications, and resulted in the hiring of less qualified applicants?

In your experience, do you feel bodycams are a hinderence to your day-to-day work, or do you feel the keep the borderline cops in line?  What is your personal opinion on civilian oversight of officer involved shootings?

In regards to training, do you feel the initial training and follow-on training prepares you for the vast situations you might encounter in such a large metropolitan city?  If inadequate, I'd be curious as to what your recommendations are.

Lastly, with regard to your personal mental health and that of your fellow officers, do you feel the work environment is supportive of seeking a therapist, and/or do they provide one?

The symptoms aren’t consistent but often will have a very noticeable effect on my life. People will notice a visible change in how I appear- tired, more pale than usual, dark circles under my eyes- and how I behave- absent-minded, sluggish, irritable. Sometimes all I want to do is sleep and/or eat, other cycles like right now I’ll experience insomnia and/or loss of appetite. I know these things can be standard, I’m not describing it well enough to make it sound like a real issue. However, I have too many stories to recount of times when my PMS symptoms contributed to poor judgment or me doing or saying something foolish that has a noticeable effect on my work or home life. I’ve never been pregnant or had kids but it almost reminds me of how “pregnancy brain” is described.
I’m looking forward to getting health insurance soon so I can go to an ob/gyn for the first time in over a decade. My suspicion is these hormonal fluctuations are going a bit too far but I really don’t know. Is there a way to help regulate this? I started taking a women’s multi-vitamin a year ago and have noticed that’s helped a little bit. I also don’t use any sort of women’s birth control like the pill or an implant, etc. How standard are these symptoms?

Also, it's possible that, if you never ever pulled it back all the way, you'll have smegma on the tip of your dick, and the tip will be hyper sensitive. 
Smegma is, iirc, dead skin which stayed because lack of hygiene. Don't fear to wash it, it will hurt a little bit because of the sensitiveness of the penis, but you'll feel relieved like never before.

This makes the infrequent sexual encounters I have quite difficult, as oral sex doesnt stimulate me at all and I don't finish fur the duration of my erection.

(1) Preventing Eggs
Birth control can stop the ovaries from releasing eggs. If the ovaries don’t release an egg, there will be nothing for sperm to fertilize.

(2) Prevent Implantation 
In order for someone to be pregnant, the fertilized egg must implant on the uterine wall. Well, if birth control can prevent the implantation...then no pregnancy! This is also what Plan B does — it forces the lining of the uterus to shed.

(3) Hostile Sperm Environment

(1) The objectifying of women to the point men think they deserve a certain look is an issue, but more to the point is that about 5% of people look the way celebrities and Stacy’s look, so population wise, it isn’t going to work out. People cannot have rigid standards for sex and love — my partner needs to be _____ (insert laundry list). When you do that, you eliminate millions of possibilities.

(3) While that egg was maturing, the uterus lining was building up with nutrients and blood, because that lining would be what a fertilized egg would need to survive as it develops into an embryo. 

(4) The egg falls through and the body realizes it doesn’t need that lining, so the uterus contracts and sheds its lining — that’s what period blood is, the shed lining of the uterus.

(1) The semen contains 300 million (give or take) sperm and those sperm are going to travel through the cervix, which is a portal to the uterus above the vagina. 

(2) Once through the cervix, the sperm will swim magnetically, almost, to the Fallopian tubes where they will look for a mature egg that has been released from the ovaries.

(3) The sperm that have survived at this point (they die along the way, it’s a tough journey) will gather around the egg and try to get the egg to meet with them. The egg and sperm kind of choose each other (fertilization), one sperm gets in most of the time and there’s one egg most of the time (if more than one sperm make it or more than one egg is present, you get twins and triplets).

(3) The fertilized egg will find its way down from the Fallopian tube and head towards the uterus. 

**all of the aforementioned steps can take up to 3 days to happen. Sperm survive in the uterus and Fallopian tubes for quite some time 

(4) The fertilized egg (zygote) must then implant on the uterus wall —&gt; that is pregnancy.

It would be difficult to find such therapists in India probably. Very few people would be open to having a conversation about sex presumably. But your answer is reassuring nonetheless.

So yes there is a sense of shame that mostly results because I do not know if it is normal to have such thoughts. It's not a problem to others as such because I have not been able to open up about this to them, because well such conversations can be awkward and discomfiting. Probably religious exposure in childhood sort of contributes somewhat to making these thoughts a little tormenting sometimes. However it is a lot lesser than before, because I have come to accept them to some extent.

So I tell people, be careful with what tools your children have and at what ages. 

Pornography is everywhere. We use sex to sell everything and sex is everywhere. The worst thing you could do is pretend it doesn’t happen...so instead, start relationship, bodies and media literacy conversations early. Teach your son about what he sees and be a little cautious about what he watches and the messages therein. 

Also, be careful with his friends. Boys will watch porn because they get introduced by someone, someone’s older brother. Don’t prevent your son from a social life, but before he goes and sleeps over somewhere, just know that porn is likely on the menu.

To quote: “Research does not support these myths, but there is research to suggest that such policies may ultimately be counterproductive,” 

As for what they deserve: I think the purpose of any institution of society should be to improve it and I reject moralistic notions of what people “deserve” on the grounds that what people often think criminals deserve does not materially improve society as we prioritize retribution over making our society better and reducing the risks of such crimes happening again. There’s also the issue of non-offending pedophiles who can not seek out therapy to help make sure they don’t offend in the first place, but because we have such a kneejerk reaction against them we have legislated that a therapist must on threat of losing their license report any such person to legal authorities whether they’ve committed a crime or not which then gets them put on a sex offender registry anyways which basically makes the social pariahs incapable of being full members of society and alienating them from any possibility of communal identity; this dissuades non-offending pedophiles from seeking out treatment increasing the risk that children do get hurt.

In the first outcome, there is sin, death, and the prolonging of a life. In the second there is no sin and two deaths. Therefore the most moral outcome is the second.

This situation, however, is unfair. When the choice is made on whether or not to abort, there is no knowledge on the outcome, so the situation would better be posed as “What about a situation where the child dies and the mother doesn’t or the child has a 0.625% chance of being stillborn and the mother has a 0.0264% chance in dying during childbirth, assuming she lives in the US.” Not only does the choice become easier to see, it also puts the situation into perspective. Yes, there will be situation when both do die, but they are rather unlikely, at a 0.0165% chance. I’m not saying that it is acceptable for both to die, I’m saying it’s unacceptable for anyone to die, but that doesn’t mean we play executioner. If we want situations like that to stop happening, we improve our medical knowledge so that both stillbirth and child birth death are unheard of, not permit the death of one for the safety of another. No life is greater than another’s.

In other words, the hypothesis attempts to account for why siblings don't become sexually attracted to each other.

This hypothesis would go a long way toward explaining why your half sister and you developed an attraction toward each other despite being closely biologically related. Since you weren't actually reared together, you simply didn't have a chance to develop the ""normal"" sexual avoidance of each other.

This AMA is an opportunity for readers to interact with and examine the strong cultural gut-reaction of taboo. 

For those who aren’t blinded by an initial emotional reaction, there is much insight to be gained about our cultural identity by contemplating how a “deviant” may actually be dignified or intelligent. If a “deviant” is well-spoken, even-keeled, respectful and communicates a concern for other's well being, do they deserve to be shunned? Or is it the more that creates the reaction unconsciously? 

Many people have said it but it deserves to be asked again— if no one is being harmed, what exactly is the problem? Given the wide range of “acceptable” violence and abuse in American society, the puritanical reaction to sexuality is always stark.

There are multiple definitions of atheism. Most atheists define it as ""lack of belief in a god"" (this is the minimum requirement to be an atheist), some goes a step further and say ""I believe there is no god"" and then even fewer says ""There are no god(s)"".

Alot of theists like to define it as: ""There definately are no gods!"", because that is an easier definition to argue against, making them seem less irrational in contrast.

I am an agnostic atheist, and I don't know whether or not there is a god, but i believe there are no gods.

First of all, neurodivergence is worth taking into consideration. There are many people who feel like their neurodivergence in some way affects their gender, which is a big portion of people with xenogenders. This might seem like 'making their neurodivergence their whole identity', but a lot of people don't understand how being ND can often affect the entire way your brain works and how you view yourself. So it makes perfect sense to me how it could affect gender identity for an individual; I'm autistic and that definitely has *some* influence on it for me.

&gt;I feel like that's relating to an animal, and animals aren't genders.

The color pale lemon yellow and the letter e are inexplicably tied to my gender (might be my mild synesthesia, which is another example of how being ND could influence it tbh) so I don't find it utterly wild that someone could tie their gender with an animal.

You might get a better answer from someone who uses those sorts of pronouns but this is all I can offer ig

Uh, that's a very good one. Honestly, it seems so simple now, but learning about the differences between holistic and individualistic cultures made alot of the world make much better sense. 


For those who do not know holistic cultures are very group-oriented. The role an individual plays in a family, or a group is often a main priority and can superseed the individuals wants. 
Whereas the individualistic cultures are as we know them in the west, focused on the individual gain. 


There are of cause nuances all over the world, but those two templates made me understand the cultures clashes in my own country alot more and gave me a new perspective which I believe could be to the betterment of all if taught properly. 

That, and just how much of our situational experiences go into our decision making and behavior.

I explained that I was still getting a lot of medical tests done and she decided I was in denial about how anxious I actually was.

I don’t know if there’s an alternative but it has always rubbed me the wrong way that voters in New England and the South have the same influence over federal laws under which the voters of the West Coast also have to live, despite these regions being worlds apart in terms of culture, resources, values, and industry. 

Federal overreach has been unstoppable since the start, and I don’t think there’s any way to roll back focus to states’ rights. But honestly, if Alabama wants to teach creationism in their schools, fine. We’d cut off federal funding, but they can teach anything they want under private funds. If Florida wants to ban transgender athletes from competing alongside their aligned gender groups, go for it. Just don’t tell Oregon or Washington that they have to follow suit.

But the neighbors were not to fond of the facility being there.

Anyway. She used to work the night shift every night. From 10 to 7. So I decided to get up early that morning drive over to where she lived and surprise her with some flowers. So I got there early and parked in front of a house next to the one she lived in. I waited about ten minutes and I see her leave the house she worked in and begin to make her way home. 
I get out of the car. Put the flowers behind my back. I shut the door. She sees me. I smile. She smiles delighted. I see two cop cars coming down the street at high speeds. I say oh shit. The cop cars pull up to me and two officers get out asking what I was doing there. 
I tell them that I was there to see my girlfriend. They ask me to show them what's behind my back. I pull out the flowers. The two officers tell me to have a nice morning but to watch where I park on the street. They drive off. My girlfriend runs up to me laughing.

Soon as he moved back to our home city he cut all contact. Even reaching out to him through his parents didn’t work which was odd since he was staying with them. It got to the point that we suspected he had been arrested for growing shrooms or something and his parents were too embarrassed to talk about it. Then he randomly showed back up at my friend’s place like nothing had changed, smoked a bunch of our weed, said he’d try to keep in touch better, then left and went radio silent again. 

Pretty sure he is just a mild sociopath or maybe he got too embarrassed when he tossed us aside in preparation for one of his soon to be successful (not so much) get rich quick schemes that he was always working on (turned out to be a MLM at least once). In any case we’ve all given up on him at this point.

My biggest issue with what you're saying is ""unable to pay off their debt if they chose a reasonable degree"" It's not just about being unable to pay the debt off, although that's certainly an issue. It's bigger than that. It's the pressure that such a large costs adds.

I absolutely abhor democracy of any kind on the principle that that the majority of people can't make good decisions for themselves, let alone for the collective.

Think that there more bad people in the world than good ones.

Find Cardi B music, Tiktok and many other things reddit hates that don't really hurt anybody to be okay or at least nothing to be upset about or bothered by.

Don't hate Michael Bay movies.

Think the vast majority of redditors don't know a lot of people and have a very limited understanding of the human experience, often labeling people into simple classes that don't correlate with the real world.

I was an introverted kid when growing up, I was socially akward aswell and I didn't know how to have a normal conversation with other kids. I was getting bullied alot for it and learned that if I keep things to myself, less harm will come my way.

Thanks to the years of drama club and some amazing people I met there, I changed from an introvert to a person who can start up conversations with strangers with ease. But it didn't change the way of how I bottle things inside me.

To mom I always seem like I don't care about anything and that I'm always calm in hard situations ""like an alien"".

It started pissing me off when I knew very well that it's not like that, but whenever I stand up for myself, she looks shocked and starts getting more angry at me for talking back. It's like if I'm not acting as I did when I was 12 (shy, quiet, doesn't talk and doesn't get involved), she thinks I'm a completely different person, out of this world. 

I think I got a bit off amd ranted a bit, sorry for that.

when exactly? also, you kind of are to the point where its frightening. i just came here to tell you how to be more persuasive to people who aren't vegans and your hostility is basically leaking off the page.

assume I only eat meat. or assume i am vegan. would that change how you approach the conversation? would i get labeled as a demon or an ally in your mind?



""The whole ‘baby murderer’ thing isn’t an apt description because most people don’t view a foetus as a baby""
plenty of people do. and many people don't feel animals have the same rights as humans. you should know that by now given your online experience. i am telling you how to work around that difference to help make those values more normalized. 




""I didn’t ask for your advice, I’m not trying to sell you something""
if that's the case, what is it that you do online 99% of the time? pick fights and troll with no end goal? 



""most people have basic values not to rape/torture/abuse/murder others for no good reason""
basic values against their own kind. murdering animals that are traditionally eaten as food? there is no basic universal value shared for this. i'm not going to drive over to my friends farm and preach to him and his family to not eat animal/animal products. unless its something universal, there is no guarantee people will grow up with the same values or develop the same values. 




"" the vegan that’s actually turned the most people vegan (Gary Yourofsky) is abrasive as fuck so what you’re saying is not actually rooted in reality.""

because people shared the same values with respect to animals. either that, or they lacked exposure into food manufacturing completely. most of the people you talk (argue) with do not hold your values, they are also aware of how products are made by now. you won't get much farther by preaching unshared values; did you actually convince anyone?",gvravt2,False,t3_mvc7ra,False,t1_gvr4i6n,1,True,AskReddit,0,1985

All it is is an extra distraction on your wrist and in terms of fitness tracking you don't need to have a full colour led touchscreen on your wrist for that because when you're exercising you're not looking at your wrist. knowing how many steps you take in a day isn't really useful information and I'm pretty sure a lot of the sensors are pretty inaccurate.

 The only redeeming feature the watch had was that I could use Spotify offline on the watch  and save playlists to it which meant I didn't have to take my phone with me when exercising but recently they took away that feature so now I completely regret my purchase and wish I could get my money back.

I think fitbit figured it out that smartwatches really only make sense for fitness and there's no point having fancy screens and apps on your wrist. If only they could add offline music playback for spotify, apple music, etc.",gvrakhq,False,t3_mxnf10,True,t3_mxnf10,0,True,AskReddit,0,1162

No, you don't. That was never the point of cable, outside of channels like HBO.

Originally, there were only a few channels that one had access to, all of them over-the-air. Say, NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX, PBS, and maybe one or two more, if you're lucky. Then when cable came about, people went, ""Wow, by paying a subscription, I can get access to a hundred more channels!"". These channels still had ads.

With the rise of streaming services (which do not typically have ads if you're paying for them), ordinary cable TV seems out of place, and is receding in popularity as a result. But somehow, it has become a part of the Reddit hivemind consciousness that the *point* of cable was TV with no ads, which was simply not the case (with few exceptions, like the aforementioned HBO).",gvrabmd,False,t3_mxnf10,False,t1_gvqoykv,5,True,AskReddit,0,847

Even so when doing the maths it usually involves cents in it. And nobody wants to wait in line just coz someone changed their mind and I have to pull out a sheet of paper and do the maths. 

24-15 is easy. But if you’re ever a cashier it tends to involve 24.20-50.55. It’s usually with cents which makes it more time consuming. I pull out a sheet of paper coz mental maths with cents has more room for error and I’m not taking that risk on my job. 

Yes most time people don’t change it more than once. But allowing people to change their minds in the first place leaves potential for people to change their minds a lot.

8920,lurkinandshirkin,t2_4yb3vmm6,False,"Thanks for taking the time to respond. I really appreciate it and will think about what you said when I get around to my second watch. You are absolutely right about the love and care they took with every scene of the film. Everything from direction, acting, art/set/costume/etc. was top notch and it was visually stunning. Music and score too.

I think the plot lines of DiCaprio's decline and Pitt's run in with the Manson family did not match up at all and the overall pacing was just off to me. It felt to me like a very incoherent mashup of a variety of Hollywood scenes and gags, which as I write this I realize might have been part of the whole point of the film?

When I watch something like Django, I think of the how Tarantino plays with tension throughout the entire Candy Land sequence. Constantly building tension, then loosening its grip only to squeeze harder and harder over and over until you finally get that gun shot from Dr. Shultz finally releasing it all in one singular moment. None of that skill is shown off in Once Upon A Time at all because it is so disjointed to me. That is not to say that Once Upon A Time needed to have that same energy or emotion; it is a very different emotional space from any of Tarantino's other films imo. There just seemed to be a lack of any cohesion in the film from scene to scene or in any of the characters outside of DiCaprio and Pitt. Everything seemed confusing and just really off. 

I am sure I had a very emotional reaction to all of that when I first saw it. I had very high expectations of Once Upon A Time In Hollywood and I hope that when I revisit it I can see it in a better light. Thanks again for sharing with me! Cheers!

Doesnt matter that you smile and speak in a pleasant tone of voice. You are actively going out of your way to prevent an employee from doing their (only) assigned task and putting them in an uncomfortable situation with their employer. 

A prime example: my retail shop has a clear sign saying mask required for entry. I have a regular who is generally a super sweet lady that I've helped for 2 years now. But ever since covid she comes in every week without a mask, no matter how many times we provide her with and ask her to wear one. Yea shes polite and pleasant to interact with outside of that, but shes still being selfish and inconsiderate of me trying to do my job in the manner my company expects and I've lost respect for her as a result. If break the rules for one customer, regardless of how nice they are, then I open myself up to more customers trying to take advantage. 
Same goes for IDs. I check IDs on every single guest because that's what I've been instructed to do. Idgaf if your 60 and have grey hair. You can give me your ID at the register, or you can go home with nothing. Yea I could override the ID scanner for someone who's clearly an adult, but my employer doesnt like when we do that and the second I let it slide once, the customer will continue to come with no ID until I begin to refuse sales. 

It is a matter of consistency.
