1. Fair enough. I just wanted to know if u are a quranist or not. 

2. I feel like u contradicted your own words here.. According to an authentic hadith (https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5134) aisha was 6 when she married and 9 when muhammad had sex with her. As for ur second bit.. Islam is a book for all times to come. Sure child marriages were common back then but so was slavery (which islam allows) but with time we learned that slavery and child marriages are wrong. Just because something used to be a norm doesn't mean it was okay.. And islam is not just a book for its time.. But for all times to come. Surely u can understand how problematic that is? After 6 years of having discussions with muslim preachers.. They told me he married her at 6 but only had sex with her when she was 9 because thats when she hit puberty.. And my response is.. Firstly u will need to prove me that she hit puberty at that age, secondly even if thats true.. Pedophilia isnt just having sex with minors.. Its also having a relationship with them.. Which muhanmad did by marrying her at 6. The fact he waited three years to have sex with her shows that she definitely didnt even reach puberty when she got married.

3. Here is the hadith (https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130) so seems like aisha didnt even hit puberty when she went to live with muhammad at 9 as she played with her friends and her dolls which according to this hadith is forbidden but since she was a kid it was allowed for her.

4. I guess I would ask what constitutes danger to Islam or muslims? And can u back that up with an authentic islamic source? The sources ive read clearly say apostates and blasphemers should be put to death. I may be wrong in that case i apologize however i havent read anything to suggest that. Are you familiar with the hadith where this slave woman (or master? Not sure) said something bad abt muhammad to her master/slave so he killed her and when muhammad was abt to put him to death he told him he killed her because she said something bad about muhammad so muhammad said what he did was right and he wasnt given the penalty anymore?
As for adultery.. I would say that is still extremely harsh. Sure adulterous are assholes but to put them to death is insanee and very much the opposite of peace.

5. That is factually untrue. Lots of nations are doing very well with female leaders. New Zealand for example. It became the first country to get rid of covid by installing strict measures... Even countries with lower population and a male leader have not been able to do what NZ did. Uk is one of the most powerful country in the world. And its ruled by the Queen. Women being emotional is mostly a factor of social norms of our society. There are many strong and powerful women out there who don't let emotions affect their leadership skills. Surprisingly we see a lot of male leaders nowdays being too emotional

6. I do think that is silly. Why have that for women and not for men? Why sexualize women so much that they need to be soo protected and covered when men don't have to? I apologize but what u said was very sexist. Women without hijab is like leaving them open to danger? Also evidence shows that rape isnt about lust.. Its about power.. Men who rape dont care what u dress like.. A woman can be all covered up and they would still rape if they are rapists. This is something that has been backed up by evidence. Also, how u set the social norms of your environment determines the sexualizing factor.. When u r living in a place where women are soo sexualized that even showing hair is forbidden because it might tempt men, then u know u need to fix your country. Perfect example is this; in america a woman wearing short sleeves shirt and long baggy pants is considered modest and thats what even christians there want the extend of women to show their skin.. No one finds it ""sexual"" there to see a woman like that.. But if she did the same in a muslim country, she would be considered as a sexual object because that kind of dressing isnt modest enough in that environment.. However, in america,  a woman wearing a very small bikini and underwear is something thats sexualized and deemed ""bad"" in america so if a woman does that there, people see it as a sexual thing.. So its all about how you set the social norms of your place.. I can also point at africa.. There are some countries in Africa where its normal for women to have their breasts out in public and no one sees it as a sexual thing.. Why? Cos its a social norm there.. Do u know before 1936 men in usa couldn't show off their nipples in public? Because it was deemed sexual.. A movie that showed men shirtless was considered controversial.. But social norms changed.. And now men being shirtless is not a big deal at all.

I apologize for such a long reply. Thank you for your time.",,,1619303627,{},gvra8yn,False,t3_mxi5at,False,True,t1_gvr3kyl,/r/AMA/comments/mxi5at/im_a_muslim_with_pretty_good_knowledge_of_my/gvra8yn/,1619320056,1,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],,

2. Not that I can think of right now. I’m sure there is though.

3. I was raised in a very conservative, small minded, racist house. When I joined the military that was the first time I was really around anybody different than me. I have been reevaluating my biases ever since. 

4. You kind of nailed it already. The big thing is just getting out of the car and talking to people. Ignorance is the enemy of trust. Learn and teach others. Show what I carry with me. Answer questions. Ask questions.

long story:

for reference, i've been clean for nearly 2.5 years now.

honestly i don't know what clicked for me. i was self-harming on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times a day. i was in therapy with a plethora of different therapists and i often ditched them after one or two visits because they all said the same generic shit that meant nothing.

if i had to say, it's not that i wanted to stop, because it helped me feel alive.

but i was hurting the people i loved. it wasn't just me. my mom, my friends, my sister, my ex at the time. every time i relapsed and came to them and they saw my wrists or my thighs or my arms or whatever, they would have the saddest look on their face. they never blamed me, but i couldn't keep seeing that sadness in their eyes. i realized i had to stop before it went too far and i couldn't ever keep my loved ones happy.

i have an app called ""I Am Sober"" (for all sorts of addictions) where you can log your feelings, how many days you've been clean, talk with other people who are in the same milestone ballpark as you, and a bunch of other stuff. it's helped a lot.

alongside making music, drawing art, going out and enjoying time with my sister, having virtual dates with my partner who lives 400+ miles away during a pandemic. it's the little things that remind me why i'm staying alive and staying clean.

it's so hard to recover but i truly believe in my heart everyone has at least one reason. they just have to find it, and i believe they'll also do that at the right time.",,,1619300335,{},gvr3yav,True,t3_mxso5e,False,True,t1_gvr2g2e,/r/AMA/comments/mxso5e/i_attempted_suicide_7_times_during_my_teen_years/gvr3yav/,1619316671,1,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],,

1. Do I believe in hadiths?
Yes, they are the 2nd source of shari'a after quran and a muslim who doesn't believe in them is basically neglecting a big part of his religion.

2. Aisha was 6 and Islam allows pedophilia.
No that's not true at all. There's no solid proof of her age when she got married, and even if she was, you have to consider the traditions and norms at that place and time (adulthood was defined as when someone hit puberty back then), and Islam does not allow pedophilia in any way, shape or form.

3. She was playing with her dolls which is forbidden.
There's nothing that forbids playing with dolls, if you meant something else please let me know.

4. Adulterous, blasphemers, and apostates are to be put to death.
Blasphemers and apostates are only put to death if they're dangerous to Islam and muslims, and are free to live their lives within an Islamic community otherwise.

Now those who commit adultery are to face different penalties depending on a number of things. First, if an unmarried (virgin) man commits adultery with an unmarried (virgin) woman, their penalty is a hundred lashes each and banishment for a year. And if a married (or had been married previously) man commits adultery with a married (or had been previously married) woman, their penalty is stoning to death.

5. No nation could succeed with a woman leader.
I believe that could be true to some extent, women get emotional sometimes and that might affect the decisions taken if the full lead was in a woman's hand. Although that doesn't stop a woman from being a leader today as most of the decisions are taken in some sort of parliament which has male and female members

6. How I feel about hijab.
If you have an expensive gem, you'd want to hide it from everyone and keep it safe. That's exactly what hijab is.

This has disadvantages, too, however.  I saw an employee break a finger through their own fault, and they got put on extremely light duty for four months at UPS.  I've broken fingers playing sports and I returned in two weeks.


Also, remember that unions take a large chunk of money anyways.  I got paid more monthly at Amazon working for $16/hr compared to UPS paying $19/hr.  Considering the qualifications for working at Amazon, I think $16/hr starting pay is ridiculously generous.


I am in favor of unions for people that work full-time, but the majority of UPS and Amazon employees in the warehouse are part-time.  I don't want to see such a hefty union due if employees aren't even getting paid $50 a day because there simply isn't enough work to have them there more than two hours.

About a year ago, I was driving to visit my wife at the hospital one more time before she went to bed. I had been delayed and visiting hours were shorter due to COVID and I was in danger of missing the window entirely. I was speeding, driving over a bridge, downtown.  The gigantic police officer who pulled me over asked me where I was headed and I blurted out ""Sorry Officer, I'm going to visit my wife in palliative care at the hospital before visiting hours end.""

He took ID back to his car, came back about 2 min later and said ""I'm just going to give you a warning tonight. That rate of speed was dangerous. I'm sure your wife wouldn't want to get a ticket or worse, be in an accident. Take care.""

I think about that Police Officer's kindness a lot and ever since that day - I do not speed out of respect for him. Had I gotten the ticket, I'm sure I'd rationalize that I 'paid my debt' to society.

However, your eye twitching  is a pre-signal of the migraine. You should stop all activities if possible, sit calmly in a place and close your eyes. A darker place would be better or you can wear your eye band. Take some deep breathe and calm yourself down. This may take some 20 to 30 minutes for you to feel having regained your composure. Slowly come out of the process avoiding very bright light and giving your eyes to adjust again to the normal lighting condition.

Be aware also, This is nearly done on spot and at times you would have no option than to  carry your anti-migraine tablet and take it on getting the pre-signal or when the pain is already there or has become severe.

Migraine, actually indicates you need to pay attention to something related to your lifestyle, which the body is signaling to you.

For example, let's take the time I worked at UPS as a package loader (union).  Oftentimes the starting pay would be around $19.00 an hour.


Most employees get around 90 minutes of work each day, so we'll round up and say each employee is getting 8 hours a week, which means $152 a week.  Each week they would take off my hourly wage multiplied by 1.33 (I believe it was), so I'm getting paid closer to $125 a week.  The first paycheck of each month also takes off $50 for union dues, meaning that I'm losing about $75 of my paycheck because of union dues.


That is my main reason as a worker.  I was a part time supervisor at UPS, and during that time I saw that unions also protect employees that should've been let go a long time ago.

I think that two things can be true at once. There has undoubtedly been a massive increase in people identifying as trans within the past few years, but it honestly makes sense because of the increase of awareness and acceptance that's been going on. If I was born 10 years earlier, I probably would have either came out a lot later or committed suicide. 

However, when something becomes a hot topic, people like to jump on the bandwagon. I do think that some people, especially young girls, have confused other issues for gender dysphoria. Proper psychological examinations before making any medical decisions is important imo. I don't know if I think that *most* people are confused/faking it, but I think there are probably a large number of people that have got a bit muddled up and will hopefully figure themselves out later. 

Detransitioning (after starting medical transition) really isn't common in my country though. If you take the NHS route, you sit on a waiting list for years and go through psychological examinations before being given hormones/approved for surgeries. I was diagnosed with Transsexualism (ICD10 F64.0) before I was given testosterone (it's called gender incongruence in the newest version of the ICD I think).

An officer needed to take pictures of bruising for evidence on a charge I had filed, and he refused me an escort, refused me a female police officer, and refused me an additional officer to make me feel safe, so I decided not to allow the pictures and charges were dropped. The bruising was on my breasts. As a result, 4 days later, the police were called to force me to go home, because child abuse was unfounded. It was 2 new officers on the scene, and I tried to explain what had happened and volunteer for the pictures then, but they refused to listen to me. Instead, I did juvenile detention time for assaulting my stepmother, from when I punched her back in self-defense.

At 16, I was arrested again for shoplifting (one-time thing - I was a troubled kid but I’m better now), and I was interrogated by a female police officer, who told me she’d worked for my city for 10 years.

---------|----------|----------|
What do you think about blm?|Great message that was twisted by people who had other ideas. I’m all for protest and speech and all that. 100%. I’ll even get my ass o it there with you. Mob mentality is a dangerous thing though. Unfortunately that’s what came o in a lot of places. Not all. We had our own sizable demonstrations that stayed peaceful and were given a lot of freedom to make their message heard. Not everywhere was so lucky. Peaceful ones don’t make headlines.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq3787/)
Has your job affected any relationships with friends/family? Especially now I know that being a cop can affect people’s views.|Absolutely, but not much more than being in the military effected it. Relationships are weird being a cop. Everyone like to point it out, which is kind of a pain in the ass. “Oh shit the cops are here. Hahaha”. I just want to get a burger. Don’t call me out like that. Also really weird schedules. My close relationship me are fine. My wife is really supportive and knows I have some unique experience regularly. Like some times I just need to come home and be alone. Sometimes it’s let me take a quick shower and let’s go to dinner. My close friends are the same.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq45vo/)
With the way things have been lately, how do you deal with the stress that any call can go sideways? Do you approach the situation on the alert or deal with things in the moment?|Both? All this is nothing new to cops. I’ve only been on road for five years but it’s always been this. A welfare check on a house could be someone butt dialed 911 or there is an active aggravated assault. The car you pulled over swerving could be someone who dropped a coffee in their lap or a drunk guy with a suspended license, two active warrants and a gun. You almost become relaxed in you state of alert. That’s normal. That’s why departments are really pushing a lot of tools used by the military to decompress mentality. I’m very fortunate that my pd has those programs and I brought mine from the army.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq4rka/)
I'm a British Police Authorised Firearms Officer, I'm curious how long your training and your probationary period was?|Total in-house and academy training was about 10 months. Field training was four months. Then 12 months of a fairly in depth probationary period. Other departments are different but they follow the same general timeline.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq7pzs/)
American?|Yes|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq30n0/)
What’s the best part of the job? The worst part?|Kids. Happy kids are awesome. Hurt kids put my head in a weird place.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq3aqs/)
In your opinion, why are fellow officers unwilling/unable to stop other officers from doing absolutely shady and illegal things?|I have no idea. I’ve never seen it. In fact I’ve never really seen any officer try to pull shady shit. I know that’s not really the answer you’re looking for but I can’t really give you one. Maybe I work in a fucking magical land of policing but my department is totally cool with calling others out. Internal investigation is a pretty common thing. Usually it’s a misunderstanding or only hearing half the story. If some shady shit is going down that stops quick.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq3cic/)
Also, living in the south are there any incidents that have occurred/you’ve responded to that are unique to the area?|Not really. We’re near a military base and a (kind of) large university so our population is really diverse. I guess that would be the unusual part of my area.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq3fu2/)
Do you have a favorite cop movie?|Hot Fuzz. No question.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq3ma4/)
do you watch brooklyn nine-nine?|I have been told so many times to watch it but I just can’t get into it. I’m not a big tv show guy anymore.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq47ob/)
What are your thoughts on qualified immunity?|I think qualified immunity should stay. If I were to do something on duty, I am as tiny as a member of the department. I can’t make personal statement. I can’t make personal decisions. Everything I do represents the department. If someone fucks up, the department fucked up by giving them that authority. Go after the department, not the individual. That is not a defense of anyone in particular. Just a personal stance.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq6ux4/)
What do you believe should be done to improve relations between the police and the public?|This. Or things like this. Talking. I change of ideas. Cops are more than a badge. People are more than suspects or victims. Talking won’t solve anything but it’s a damn good place to start.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxnfsk/im_a_cop_ama/gvq7hq7/)

I’m a female, mid-20s, never orgasmed. I’m married and am my husband’s first sexual partner. I had sexual partner before him but never focused on trying to orgasm (he was selfish, I was naive). 

I’ve come what feels close to orgasming through oral and rubbing stimulation but have never been successful. I enjoy sex without orgasming, but I know I’m missing something, which I believe is affecting my sex drive. How can I come to orgasm?

I know the typical suggestion is to learn my body and what I like, but truthfully I find it difficult to stay aroused while masturbating. I get too in my head/discouraged I think to continue. It feels embarrassing to not know what my own body wants as an adult.

Pornography should be consumed in moderation and with literacy. Mainstream porn is not real. These people have sex professionally, for hours at a time.

I always say there's a difference between knowledge and wisdom. People are encouraged to gain all kinds of knowledge in Islam but aren't learning the wisdom behind things. Like we memorize verses and teach kids to memorize them but sometimes fail to understand the meaning and the purpose behind these ayat, so we're essentially becoming parrots who just repeat.

And like what you mentioned things about manners. There tends to be people who even though they are praying 5 times, fasting and doing whatever we should be doing, but still have rude attitudes and our character is not matching Islam and doesn't resemble the character of the prophets. Since the prophet muhammad. alayhi salaat wa salaam, said ""whoever is better in manners is better in religion"", it seems to be a big issue that we need to address more.

I think when there are muslims who are only muslim by name see the muslim who does practice certain things but is rude or judgemental it can be very discouraging for them to want to have Islam in their lives more. We are not The Most Just of Judges, and if we were given other peoples lives we may have made worse decisions with them.

I really like your point on discussions with peoples concerns or fears in religion especially young people. We should be more open to controversial subjects, that's the only way we'll understand how to get through them. Also certain subjects in Islam that seem controversial when you are uninformed, but once you do become informed are not controversial at all. Let's talk about the hard things and not shy away from them.

Like After I have a tic attack I’m super tired and sore. But what sucks the most is when I have to get sedated because of me punching myself in my face. it’s almost like I’m extremely tired but I cannot sleep. No matter how much I tried I couldn’t sleep but I was way to tired to do anything so I just had to lay there for what felt like days because I was so out of it. Anytime  someone tried to talk to me I was confused and disoriented. But then when I finally got to sleep I slept for 21 hours straight. But for the next two days I’m was still extremely tired but able to make it through the day. 

Another consequence is I throw up, which I hate. 
I have a tic that stops me from breathing for a period of time and after it was over I threw up so much. It was terrible.

When I have a paralysis tic my body is constantly going limp, then I get back up, then I’m back down. So my head is moving quite fast in a short period of time which makes me extremely sick.

Women orgasm from clitoral stimulation. Most women only from clitoral stimulation. It has the most nerves and is the most sensitive part of her body. Look up a picture of the clitoris — the pea-sized “button” people talk about is just a fraction of the clitoris, it is a larger element than people realize.

This means that penetrative sex needs to also stimulate her, potentially with fingers or a toy that is curved. Women orgasm from clitoral stimulation the most, then vaginal penetration, then anal penetration. Some women report orgasm from breast stimulation alone. 

It can seem like men need to get their partners off with their penis, but that’s a stereotype about masculinity and misinformation about how sex works for people. 

Using your hands while penetrating is like frying and egg in one pan with one hand and writing down a manifesto in the other. It’s really hard to do both of those things at once — the clitoral stimulation will be less orgasmic. You might try having her hold a vibratos while you penetrate her — that’s considered the holy grail of achieving mutual orgasm.

Some people find clitoral stimulation their best route to orgasm, but how intense their clit feels arousal will vary. That’s why some girls cannot do vibrators and others love them.

2) What kind of porn does your partner watch and why does it make you somewhat uncomfy? If you are uncomfortable with the kind of porn he likes, definitely talk it through. If you are insecure about your body from the women of porn (this is the most likely from our research, although not always true!), then definitely work through that. If your partner is using porn to replace you, then that’s an issue to take to a therapist together....or if he has a porn addiction as you can see. 

When people watch porn, it isn’t cheating and it is healthy and normal as long as in moderation and not with content that disturbs one or the other partner. Your partner probably has used porn more regularly for sex than other things.

Your feelings are valid and your input matters. I do appreciate you realizing saying something could be controlling — balance in everything ☀️",,,1619276299,{},gvploty,True,t3_mxan9q,False,True,t1_gvnu86w,/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvploty/,1619288296,1,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],,

There are all kinds of penises and all kinds of circumcision and skin that results from it. If you are in pain, then certainly seek medical attention. If you want to have a cosmetic surgical procedure to alter your foreskin, see someone in plastic surgery or a doctor generally. 

Are you “normal?” Well good sir, if you have a penis that can maintain an erection and you can orgasm, then everything is going fine. Do you have perhaps more skin beneath the head of the penis than all other men? This depends on where you live. Our bodies develop as we age and that includes the penis.

That is a really good question! And one that I have thought about and discussed a lot with my family 

So here's my take on it, I think that we should try to focus on the principles of Islam rather than the minor details that a lot of Sheikhs and Muslims seem to be focusing on today, so we should be more concerned with community support and giving out Zaka and Sadaqat and finding ways to help others rather than focus on what women should be wearing or what medicines break the fast, even though those issues are important, they shouldn't be the main focus

We should be looking into leading with our behavior and mannerism, to let our Islam show through our good actions and forgiveness and tolerance, to read Quran and try to understand it every time, not just read it to increase the number of times you finished reading it. 

To allow discussions regarding religion, especially with young people, let them speak out their fears and concerns and insecurities about religion, and help them understand them and overcome them rather than shut them down and saying that's Haram you shouldn't say that 

These are just a few of the thoughts I have on this topic, but I believe Allah will guide us if we truly wish to do the right thing for the sake of Islam

Even in Sunna and Quran terrorism is not condoned

My only explanation for their behavior is that they were brainwashed by some group into thinking this somehow is the right thing to do, or filled with hate speech against ""Non-muslims"" and therefore resort to violence 

Yes Allah knows what's in our hearts and minds, he will judge us according to our actions and intentions individually. 

As for the Haddith, you can know to a certain degree which ones are legit because there is a field of study that relates to sunna and how trustworthy a haddith is based on who transcribed it or told it to others until now, they study the history of each of these people, if they were good people, weren't known for lying or committing bad acts then they consider their efforts honest. It also has to do with what's in the haddith and if it contradicts what's in the Quran and Shari'a 

I don't know much about salafists to be honest, but from what i know, they decide to live by the rules of the prophet's time and refuse to have anything adapted to today's world, which in my opinion isn't practical. But like you said everyone tries to follow what they think is right, Allah will judge in his own, just way


Yes definitely prefer us to study religion, but of course there is a difference between studying religion with the intention of understanding and then studying religion and discarding whatever doesn't fit with our own beliefs or mindset. 

So I will say this, if you would like to study religion, then please do so with an open mind and ask Allah to help guide you to the truth and he will inshallah, and try to read from different sources if you're not sure which one is right, sometimes if you compare between what's in the Quran, what's reasonable to our minds, what's in the Haddith and the spirit of Islam in general you will be able to find the truth between all the sources",,,1619268244,{},gvorlhu,True,t3_mx9hdk,False,True,t1_gvoh88a,/r/AMA/comments/mx9hdk/im_a_religious_muslim_female_and_an_arab_ama/gvorlhu/,1619275615,2,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],,

Now (since about my early to mid 30’s) it’s different. I am able to experience arousal with my husband and come to orgasm by him or when I masturbate but my overall drive is very low and I am never “in the mood”. 

Basically I can be worked up and we’ve worked together to find out what works for me and what brings me to arousal but it’s a bit of a job and can feel like a chore that needs to get started. Once I’m aroused I have a great time. 

Is it normal to not feel the impulse to get started? I want it for myself but also because I love my husband and want to bring him joy too. The fact that it takes work even to feel arousal to begin things means that I am never in the mood and we have sex less frequently or spontaneously. 

I’ve asked a doctor about this and didn’t get much answer. Apparently medically everything is normal down there.",,,1619265496,{},gvoias8,False,t3_mxan9q,False,True,t3_mxan9q,/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvoias8/,1619272001,2,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],,

It doesn't serve the same purpose for women, in the case of women it would only be about lust as having more than one partner serves no other purpose. 

But you should know that there are conditions for having more than one wife, they must treat them equally when it comes to spending and responsibility as well as spending time with them, otherwise they might be committing injustice which god warns about in the Quran and that it will have its own punishment

So it might be considered a perk, but it's also a big responsibility, that unfortunately some men aren't taking seriously

Mainly, my life is not worth the job. I'm a white male. I was viewed more negatively for that than the actual people we kept off the street. I ended up working in REACT (sex offenders) and that's probably even worse. 

2.   In a city of over 14 million, and less than 50k officers, do you feel you were adequately equipped for whatever situations occured during a shift? 

I never felt like I wasn't equipped. We always had the best response time and could rely on other agencies to provide support like LACS.

3.   In your experience, were new-hires with a college degree better officers? If so, do you think it should be a requirement?

I actually have my Master's degree. I don't think I've met another officer who didn't have a degree. I don't think they'd seriously consider someone without one. You have to know how to read and write at a high level. Misspelling a word can lead to a lot of problems. A lot people who end up in law enforcement and went to nice colleges usually end up working for the feds.

4.    In your experience, do you feel bodycams are a hinderence to your day-to-day work, or do you feel the keep the borderline cops in line? What is your personal opinion on civilian oversight of officer involved shootings? 

As a citizen and cop, ALL cops should have body cams. It helps us more. We get a lot of complaints about people being mistreated by cops and it's the body cams that clears them. 

5.   In regards to training, do you feel the initial training and follow-on training prepares you for the vast situations you might encounter in such a large metropolitan city? If inadequate, I'd be curious as to what your recommendations are. 

I think we handled the protests and pandemic well. If we had a massive quake, then I would be very worried.

6.     Lastly, with regard to your personal mental health and that of your fellow officers, do you feel the work environment is supportive of seeking a therapist, and/or do they provide one? 

Not really, but you get used to it. It also depends on your personality. I can stomach dealing with child molesters but probably couldn't deal with working in a jail like the sheriff's do.

7.      Im current military considering a career with the FBI after this tour, and while I know Federal vastly differs from local LE, I want to be able to make that transition with open eyes and as informed as possible. 

That's a tricky one. A lot of the vets find it very hard to transition to being an officer. They tend to be the ones who look for ""action"" instead of deescalating situations. They also don't know how to talk to people.",,,1619263752,{},gvod3mi,True,t3_mxhl69,False,False,t1_gvoa9z3,/r/AMA/comments/mxhl69/i_resigned_from_lapd_this_week_after_11_years_of/gvod3mi/,1619270028,2,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],,

That's good bc it also gets you wet and sensitive (and like said it doesn't go away after you come) + you know your partner is also still aroused/getting hard/into it rather than doing it out of some duty to ""also"" give you something. At least that's something I worry about sometimes and worrying is what will particularly make you not come. 

Last resort &amp; if she's comfortable with it, you can also ask her if she wants to finish herself/masturbate after you've come and are tired. But make it a loving and safe experience. Don't just be like ok whatever you just finish yourself, but like hold her/kiss her/touch her/whisper sexy or funny things in her ear, whatever. We actually both do this sometimes. My partner can't always come from penetration or oral or anything either. And sometimes we're both just tired but horny.

And lastly I just realised I wrote about coming a lot but for some people that's an issue and that should not mean they don't like getting the time of day. It should never be the main goal. The main goal is to make them feel nice, and wherever that gets them is fine.",,,1619262831,{},gvoacft,False,t3_mxan9q,False,True,t1_gvo1rb5,/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvoacft/,1619268994,1,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],,

In a city of over 14 million, and less than 50k officers, do you feel you were adequately equipped for whatever situations occured during a shift?

In the current political climate, do you feel this has caused a decline in overly qualified applications, and resulted in the hiring of less qualified applicants?

In your experience, were new-hires with a college degree better officers?  If so, do you think it should be a requirement?

In your experience, do you feel bodycams are a hinderence to your day-to-day work, or do you feel the keep the borderline cops in line?  What is your personal opinion on civilian oversight of officer involved shootings?

In regards to training, do you feel the initial training and follow-on training prepares you for the vast situations you might encounter in such a large metropolitan city?  If inadequate, I'd be curious as to what your recommendations are.

Lastly, with regard to your personal mental health and that of your fellow officers, do you feel the work environment is supportive of seeking a therapist, and/or do they provide one?  I can only imagine the stresses of your day-to-day as a LEO, death, murder, rape, child crimes, that stuff has to get to you.

Birth control can stop the ovaries from releasing eggs. If the ovaries don’t release an egg, there will be nothing for sperm to fertilize.

In order for someone to be pregnant, the fertilized egg must implant on the uterine wall. Well, if birth control can prevent the implantation...then no pregnancy! This is also what Plan B does — it forces the lining of the uterus to shed.

(3) Hostile Sperm Environment

I understand the desire to not want feel like you're burdening family or friends with what you're going through, I spoke to a psychologist for the first time last week for the same reason; having a non-judgemental outlet to pour everything out to can be liberating.

I won't pretend to fully understand everything your going through, we all have different journeys and experiences, but hopefully i can share a bit of wisdom I've learned along the way. Firstly don't be ashamed about feeling a bit desensitised to what your parents are going through, you need to look after yourself first and foremost. I guarantee you that if you try to take on their burdens as well it'll weigh heavy on you, and your parents would not want you to feel any additional stress or anxiety on their account. In fact, they could notice and start worrying about how you're doing as well. It's important that we deal with ourselves first before expending emotional energy on others, otherwise we're not helping anyone.

It's natural to take on different personsas around different people and groups. Everyone does it all the time, it doesn't mean that you're fake, it just means that you have social skills and can adjust in different settings. I'm totally different at work than I am with my friends (even different depending on which friends I'm hanging out with). You're still you at your core, nothing can take away from that. It's also natural for who you are to change over time, that's a good thing, it means you're evolving as a person. Remember, character is who we are when nobody else is watching. It's what we do when we're alone, and aren't trying to impress anybody other than ourselves.

The fact that you feel guilt is proof that you're not a sociopath. The best evidence that you're a good person is that you question whether you are. Evil people never wonder or care whether they are good or evil. Introspection is good, but you can't let it overwhelm you or get too much in your own head. Just try to do the next right thing whenever you have an opportunity.

With girls, it sounds a bit like you're trying to premptively protect yourself from rejection. You enjoy the chase, but as soon as it has the potential to become something more you automatically find a reason not to pursue it, because you might subconsciously be worried that it'll fail or that you'll be rejected, so you'd rather be the one to decide not to proceed, rather than risk the other person having the opportunity. The only cure to that is to just take the plunge. Relationships require vulnerability, it's scary, but no matter how it ends it's almost always worth taking the risk. Also a date is just a date, not a marriage proposal, if you guys don't connect then you haven't lost anything, don't put too much pressure on it.

If it's any consolation it sounds like you've got some pretty great date ideas, it'd be a shame if you don't give yourself a chance to try them out irl.

The hunger analogy is interesting! 

Asexuality is usually assume to be the absence of sexuality and that is untrue. People who are asexual still see the sexual world, still experience intimacy and relationships. Asexuality is a sexuality, it is how someone reacts to the sexual world and acts within their intimacies and relationships.

More than hunger, I suppose, people get pulses and rushes of lust and desire that they can feel in their genitalia, in their toes, in their breasts.

It is possible for feces to come out during anal....it’s usually a small amount and that’s to be expected 🤷🏻‍♀️ But a bowel movement will generally not happen during anal sex unless there’s an issue with continence and like diarrhea.

Otherwise, if you try anal beads, you’ll feel how the insertion feels. It can have the sensation of “I might poop” but that’s similar to the feeling good after pooping itself...right?

I actually don’t shy away from incels and I think even the hateful kind are worth analyzing. They say they are involuntarily celibate, but they want to fuck Angelina Jolie or nobody at all.

So for anyone who identifies this way, there are two elements to address:
(1) The objectifying of women to the point men think they deserve a certain look is an issue, but more to the point is that about 5% of people look the way celebrities and Stacy’s look, so population wise, it isn’t going to work out. People cannot have rigid standards for sex and love — my partner needs to be _____ (insert laundry list). When you do that, you eliminate millions of possibilities.

(2) Incels are usually celibate because of rejection. Previous rejection, fear of rejection, traumatic rejection. For that, people need to seek help in overcoming rejection. It’s a real psychological anxiety called rejection sensitivity.

(2) That matured egg might have met with a sperm from ejaculation, but since it was not fertilized, the egg will fall through the uterus and actually out through the vagina. (Eggs are microscopic and we can’t see them!)

(3) While that egg was maturing, the uterus lining was building up with nutrients and blood, because that lining would be what a fertilized egg would need to survive as it develops into an embryo. 

(4) The egg falls through and the body realizes it doesn’t need that lining, so the uterus contracts and sheds its lining — that’s what period blood is, the shed lining of the uterus.

(3) The sperm that have survived at this point (they die along the way, it’s a tough journey) will gather around the egg and try to get the egg to meet with them.

It would be difficult to find such therapists in India probably. Very few people would be open to having a conversation about sex presumably. But your answer is reassuring nonetheless.

So yes there is a sense of shame that mostly results because I do not know if it is normal to have such thoughts. It's not a problem to others as such because I have not been able to open up about this to them, because well such conversations can be awkward and discomfiting. Probably religious exposure in childhood sort of contributes somewhat to making these thoughts a little tormenting sometimes. However it is a lot lesser than before, because I have come to accept them to some extent.

---------|----------|----------|
As the soon-to-be mom of a boy, when and how do you think my husband and I should start talking to my son about pornography? We plan to educate about sex early and often in age-appropriate ways, but I think the quick access of porn on the internet warrants its own special discussion. Or discussions.|Congratulations! You are thinking so far ahead and I can’t predict quite where technology and the internet will be...  However, it is really normal for kids to seek out information about sex and bodies throughout childhood and adolescence. If he is able to use a smartphone, the natural curiosity about bodies will be addressed with that phone as a tool.  So I tell people, be careful with what tools your children have and at what ages.  Pornography is everywhere. We use sex to sell everything and sex is everywhere. The worst thing you could do is pretend it doesn’t happen...so instead, start relationship, bodies and media literacy conversations early. Teach your son about what he sees and be a little cautious about what he watches and the messages therein.  Also, be careful with his friends. Boys will watch porn because they get introduced by someone, someone’s older brother. Don’t prevent your son from a social life, but before he goes and sleeps over somewhere, just know that porn is likely on the menu.  Age-wise, ball-park...about age 8-10. Children know about the internet, they know about gender and sex differences (by 2 years old). They will be able to handle it.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvn5qvj/)
Is oral unsanitary? I love to perform and receive but I often wonder if it's unhealthy to do so.|Yes. The mouth is full of plaque and bacteria. You can get literally ever STI from the mouth and transfer it with the mouth. Kissing is sexy? 80 million swapped bacteria is sexy? Ohhhh no.  Plus (depending on you and your partner) oral sex can cause yeast infections and you can wreck a girl’s ph balance with whatever you ate or smoked earlier. Brush your teeth, clean your tongue on the reg.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvn0i92/)
Why is blowing into a vagina dangerous but pushing air into the vagina (queef) isn't?|This is a great question. To start, a queef is when the air squeaks out of the vagina because air has been pushed in (not the pushing itself, but the sound it makes when air is squeezed out).  The vagina is a muscle, it will adapt, improvise and overcome. Physics dictates that an object placed inside another must replace whatever was there previously (air in this case). Thus, what causes queefing is just the erect penis replacing the air that had been “pushed” just so subtly, accompanied by vaginal lubrication.  If someone were to blow air into the vagina, that air pressure would then put pressure on the cervix — causing pain like IUDs or a fraction childbirth, basically.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvn18wp/)
Do kegels really work? Does it make sex better? I'm thinking about getting some Kegel balls.|The pelvic floor is incredibly important to female reproductive health and sexual pleasure. Pelvic floor surgeons and physical therapists work on kegel-type exercises, without the “pop culture” feel of “making me tighter” kinds of sexual matters, but more with working muscles to avoid vaginal pain.  But if you are considering kegels, I’m assuming you have a clitoris? Sex for you wouldn’t necessarily get better with kegal balls. You are better off strengthening the kegels with exercising or buy kegels balls just for the feeling/sensation.  So generally, no to kegal balls but yes to kegal muscles helping with your body!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvn34tk/)
Do all girls release fluid when they orgasm? If i didn't doss that mean i didn't orgasm?|Great question! There is no “all girls” do anything when it comes to orgasms, except that the female orgasm lasts much longer than men’s and is more powerful for longer.  The clenching and releasing feeling of and orgasm does not require liquid ejaculation. The “squirting” people see in pornography, is not average and regularly models drink water to pee clear and push it out with such pressure.  More common is increased vaginal lubrication for a moment (followed by some drier climates sometimes) or a few dribbles or ejaculation, not like an explosion.  You can absolutely orgasm without ejaculating anything! 👍🏻|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvn3o90/)
Is squirting actually pee &amp; is every woman capable of achieving whatever it is?|Great question! Squirting is not urine, although urine is regularly found in female ejaculate fluid. We don’t know enough about the female orgasm let alone ejaculate...however we do know that it is possible for a female to “squirt” and it is not the same consistency as urine.  Is every female capable? Perhaps physically, but arousal and pleasure are more about your brain than your physical body...so with such variance in women, I would say no, overall. Plus squirting is not something all women should try to emulate...it’s regularly shown in porn by women peeing after drinking only water for 24 hours and pushing it out really hard and fast.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvn4win/)
have any funny or strange stories from teaching? you seem like a great teacher !!|Hahaha mostly I get great questions from people. Some highlights:  - I once had a student who thought breasts weren’t supposed to move because they didn’t move in porn. His GF’s breasts were “liquid-filled” he said.  - I get asked at 9/10 sessions if it would be safe to use two condoms (for anyone reading, the answer is no. Rubber will create holes and pores, greater chances or tearing when rubbed against itself. Two condoms is less safe).  - I’ve had men/boys correct me when I said IUD. They are SURE I meant IED (birth control or a bomb...)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvn7adq/)
[deleted]|No. It is not. At all.  We are still unaware of all the additional STIs we would have to add from anal activity. The possibilities are endless with fecal matter.  Ass to mouth? Quite literally eating shit.  Would you put your cock inside a flashlight lined with poop flecks? Probably not...but into a girl who looks hot? Sure! The sanitation is the same, just wrapped up differently.  Don’t get me wrong, anal stimulation is top notch, but it would be sanitary to do with with gloves and finger covers, lots of hand washing. Condoms would be recommended...|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvn7n6d/)
Have any students ever been traumatised (for lack of a better word) from a class due to not knowing about the concept of sex prior to the course?|GREAT question. The answer is no — they have all at least seen kissing, heterosexual intimacy, at least. The “what goes on” part is me filling in details. The traumatizing part for students is usually realizing how much they didn’t know about their own bodies.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvn99tq/)
I recently had a very large kidney stone removed by breaking it up into smaller pieces and passing those pieces in urine. A few times when I have ejaculated, these bits of kidney stones come out in the ejaculate long after most debris appears to have passed already in the urine. How is this possible?|(1) Contact your doctor with kidney concerns, I am not an MD (2) Do you have a penis...? (3) Kidney stones come out on their own time and they may still be developing time to time. A kidney stone wouldn’t come from ejaculate, but if you ejaculate with greater force (cum real hard), you might just be pressuring the area. Without urine, this would be even more painful than a standard stone...hence why I ask #2.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvn0vth/)
Why doesn’t she want me anymore?|I will probably need more details on this one. People are attracted to and remain in relationships based on balance of energy and effort.  If you gave me your and her age, I could guess based on averages.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvn94e0/)
how much dick do you get|Like in my personal life? Daily? Weekly? All time? I try to stay busy...so I have contacts all over.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mxan9q/im_a_sex_education_teacher_and_i_know_you_all/gvnbv0a/)

What made yoy start hurting yourself?|I felt numb and wanted to feel something. I was completely devoid of any emotions, and I quickly became addicted to it. I really liked doing it. My routine started to be made to fit the time I spent hurting myself. Eventually, I just kept doing it not because I liked it but because I couldn’t quit it.

My parents did catch me once at the start but they thought I stopped doing it. I got scolded heavily for it. So I really have no one to tell but Reddit. I wish you the very best. It’s hard but it can be done.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mwujyk/today_i_am_1_month_self_harm_free_for_the_first/gvn2zae/)

So you start with a primer. A primer helps to make the makeup application look smoother and last longer.
Foundation (it should match your skin tone) helps to even out the complexion. 
Concealer ( few shades lighter than skin tone) helps in brightening the under eyes. A concealer closer to your skin tone would help in concealing blemishes. 
A setting powder to lock all of that in place. 
I guess those are the most confusing and basics of steps.

But when you say ""alienating them from the communities they harm"", do you mean alienating them from children? It just seems like good sense to keep them away from children, like how we don't let violent offenders have guns. If that's not what you meant, then disregard.

I'm sorry you were harmed as a child, you didn't deserve that and it must have been difficult.

However, it is really normal for kids to seek out information about sex and bodies throughout childhood and adolescence. If he is able to use a smartphone, the natural curiosity about bodies will be addressed with that phone as a tool.

So I tell people, be careful with what tools your children have and at what ages. 

Pornography is everywhere. We use sex to sell everything and sex is everywhere. The worst thing you could do is pretend it doesn’t happen...so instead, start relationship, bodies and media literacy conversations early. Teach your son about what he sees and be a little cautious about what he watches and the messages therein. 

Also, be careful with his friends. Boys will watch porn because they get introduced by someone, someone’s older brother. Don’t prevent your son from a social life, but before he goes and sleeps over somewhere, just know that porn is likely on the menu.

To quote: “Research does not support these myths, but there is research to suggest that such policies may ultimately be counterproductive,” 

As for what they deserve: I think the purpose of any institution of society should be to improve it and I reject moralistic notions of what people “deserve” on the grounds that what people often think criminals deserve does not materially improve society as we prioritize retribution over making our society better and reducing the risks of such crimes happening again. There’s also the issue of non-offending pedophiles who can not seek out therapy to help make sure they don’t offend in the first place, but because we have such a kneejerk reaction against them we have legislated that a therapist must on threat of losing their license report any such person to legal authorities whether they’ve committed a crime or not which then gets them put on a sex offender registry anyways which basically makes the social pariahs incapable of being full members of society and alienating them from any possibility of communal identity; this dissuades non-offending pedophiles from seeking out treatment increasing the risk that children do get hurt. 

Our current system of turning them into social pariahs and alienating them from the communities they harm only results in further harm.

[],,bayan963,,,[],,,,text,t2_27pdee6c,False,False,[],"Okay so here's the thing about details, Koran in itself doesn't include details like the 72 virgins thing, it only says that there will be beautiful people of both genders for every person in heaven, that there will be rivers of wine and honey, that people will be wearing fine green fabrics and expensive jewelry of gold and silver, and that they will be at peace with the company of others, they will each have their own extravagant mansions and anything else they desire

The thing about all of this, is that it's meant to appeal to human nature of liking luxury and comfort, especially when it's technically free at that point, the cost has already been paid in this life, so all that humans desire that they were restricted or prohibited from is now allowed hence the wine and beautiful people part 

The details don't matter, what matters is that if you go to heaven you will be at peace, you will be pampered and you will be happy, those for me are the most appealing parts, I don't focus on the details especially the ones that people come up with like the number of virgins or how beautiful they will be or how much alcohol they can drink (here's a side note, the alcohol in heaven doesn't make you drunk or tipsy), those are all perverted ways to think about it in my opinion, it will not be that kind of place, we will be changed in a way where all the bad qualities in our human nature will be removed and only the best of man kind will be there

As for the question of whether Christians can be included, here's the interesting part, all of the messengers, Jesus and Moses included were delivering the same message as Islam, they were sent by the same god only to different people and their books or verses were in different languages that corresponded with the people they were sent to, so in a sense Islam is a succession of their message. 

In Koran it says that those who were faithful, belived in god and god alone, believed in the afterlife and were good people will receive their award, they will get a chance, but the most important part is believing in god as the only god, that Jesus was not his son nor the Holy Spirit anything but his creation as we are

That is the biggest discrepancy between Christianity, Jewdism and Islam, that both Christianity's and Jewdism's books were altered, and it was so before Islam came along because it's mentioned in the Koran several times. The miracle of the Koran is that god vowed to keep it from being altered as it is the last book, so it can be a guidance for anyone seeking god's words

---------|----------|----------|
Not a question I just needed to say congratulations that’s amazing|Thank you!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu4biw/i_am_a_recovering_13_year_heroinopiate_addict_who/gv3iky9/)
Have you ever tried Ibogaine? It's a drug that eliminates all sorts of addiction to things like meth, heroin, cocaine, etc. Although it's only legal in Mexico, there are a bunch of Ibogaine treatment facilities there for addicts that are struggling a fuck ton, and it really works!|I haven’t tried ibogaine, although I’ve had friends who tried and stayed clean for a long time. I don’t think I needed the torture associated with ibogaine, I just needed something to make me acutely aware of my inner dialogue with myself.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu4biw/i_am_a_recovering_13_year_heroinopiate_addict_who/gv3j2dt/)
Congratulations on staying off the shit.  Was the psychedelic use intended to bring about sobriety?  And how have you maintained your sobriety?|I used lsd. I have maintained my sobriety from learning to work with my own mind. It’s been a long road of studying and evolving. I am not even the same person I was 6 years ago. In my experience not understanding how to work with your own mind is the main problem with addicts. Essentially an addict has built a prison for themselves without understanding they are the warden; they look for answers everywhere but it’s inside them. Unfortunately that’s the last place anyone wants to look.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu4biw/i_am_a_recovering_13_year_heroinopiate_addict_who/gv3jco1/)
When is the best time to yell ""this is sparta!!!!""|You’ll know it when the time is right.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu4biw/i_am_a_recovering_13_year_heroinopiate_addict_who/gv3knzp/)
After the initial withdrawal I’m assuming you were constantly tired and unmotivated. How long did this last for, does it ever go away?|The worst part lasted for a week or so, and then I was sluggish and cloudy for months. It will go away, but I think someone needs to sit with it and really go into what is happening mentally. There were times I’d sit for hours just observing my negative thoughts come in waves, just observing and reminding myself thoughts aren’t real.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu4biw/i_am_a_recovering_13_year_heroinopiate_addict_who/gv3mkm9/)
Did you ever fall sleep sitting up with a lit cigarette in your hand and wake up to see just a stick of ash between your fingers?|I have fell asleep and the cigarette had burned all the way into my fingertips and blistered without waking up. I am responsible for a LOT of cigarette burns in beds and blankets.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu4biw/i_am_a_recovering_13_year_heroinopiate_addict_who/gv3rmnt/)
That's great!|Thank you!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu4biw/i_am_a_recovering_13_year_heroinopiate_addict_who/gv3xtjv/)
Do you credit the trip to your recovery? What psychedelic did you use? What was the revelation that changed your mind set? Do you trip regularly now in order to keep up this reminder of sorts?|I directly accredit the trip for my recovery. I used lsd. I wouldn’t recommend just anyone to do this, but it just so happened to work for me. The experience I had was a strange one. My mind kept splitting into more and more personalities, until I was listening to a whole village of different people have a conversation in my head. It just kept building and building in intensity until finally I was at a breaking point. All of a sudden my mind gave in to a profound realization that all these voices were my inner dialogue that I lived with daily without noticing. I had become a slave to unnoticed negative thoughts playing on repeat in the back of my mind. Once I started noticing them I realized that’s exactly why I was using the whole time, to silence them. That night I realized how to notice thought loops and understand I don’t have to identify with them.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu4biw/i_am_a_recovering_13_year_heroinopiate_addict_who/gv3jbw5/)
how hard is it to stay clean?|It wasn’t easy but it gets better with time. I took the nuclear option and cut out everyone in my life that may lead me back to it. If you give in to your thoughts easily, it’s damn near impossible. It took a psychedelic to rewire my brain to be able to do it after many failed attempts.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu4biw/i_am_a_recovering_13_year_heroinopiate_addict_who/gv3own7/)
Are whippets as dangerous as heroin?|I don’t know, I wouldn’t want to give bad advice but I can say heroin is just about the most dangerous thing to play with that I can think of. I would recommend any drugs tbh. Just because something worked for me doesn’t mean it would work for anyone else.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu4biw/i_am_a_recovering_13_year_heroinopiate_addict_who/gv3t0mw/)
So, youre 19 now, or you quit heroin when you were seven?|I was a 13 year addict, not 13 year old addict|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu4biw/i_am_a_recovering_13_year_heroinopiate_addict_who/gv3zt69/)

In the first outcome, there is sin, death, and the prolonging of a life. In the second there is no sin and two deaths. Therefore the most moral outcome is the second.

This situation, however, is unfair. When the choice is made on whether or not to abort, there is no knowledge on the outcome, so the situation would better be posed as “What about a situation where the child dies and the mother doesn’t or the child has a 0.625% chance of being stillborn and the mother has a 0.0264% chance in dying during childbirth, assuming she lives in the US.” Not only does the choice become easier to see, it also puts the situation into perspective. Yes, there will be situation when both do die, but they are rather unlikely, at a 0.0165% chance. I’m not saying that it is acceptable for both to die, I’m saying it’s unacceptable for anyone to die, but that doesn’t mean we play executioner. If we want situations like that to stop happening, we improve our medical knowledge so that both stillbirth and child birth death are unheard of, not permit the death of one for the safety of another. No life is greater than another’s.

I am very sorry that the woman that you knew is dead. It is terrible that such a thing could happen. In a book I read recently, The Kite Runner, a man is recounting his final meeting with the mother of the protagonist, who died giving birth to him:

This hypothesis would go a long way toward explaining why your half sister and you developed an attraction toward each other despite being closely biologically related.

You seem to be handling this very rationally, I hope you’re able to retain that perspective and avoid becoming cynical or traumatized. 

This AMA is an opportunity for readers to interact with and examine the strong cultural gut-reaction of taboo. 

For those who aren’t blinded by an initial emotional reaction, there is much insight to be gained about our cultural identity by contemplating how a “deviant” may actually be dignified or intelligent. If a “deviant” is well-spoken, even-keeled, respectful and communicates a concern for other's well being, do they deserve to be shunned? Or is it the more that creates the reaction unconsciously? 

Many people have said it but it deserves to be asked again— if no one is being harmed, what exactly is the problem? Given the wide range of “acceptable” violence and abuse in American society, the puritanical reaction to sexuality is always stark.

[],,rihon31042,,,[],,,,text,t2_bju1fjtq,False,False,[],"I think I've a bit of a problem with ""preach the gospel in a less harmful way"".   


I should add that I was born and raised Catholic and never personally experienced Christianity in a harmful way. Quite the contrary, for a very long time I thought it's prime teachings to be very appealing and just the definition of 'good'. However, growing older, I did see the wrongs of the church, and as you, I attributed it to 'human failure' and it didn't really impact on my believes. I also accepted that other faiths and teaching have similar human ground-truths, and for myself I made peace by personally believing into a one-god-many-aspects-many-religions kind of thing.  The fact that *the majority* of pious people acted in a way I couldn't agree with, did bother me only at the periphery of the mind, although it was somewhat strange that 'the best Christians' should be those which are least tied to the church and its dogmatic teachings...  


I had similar issues with all the mystical aspects of the religion (wonders etc.) and how they clashed with objective truth and scientific, fact based reasoning. I kind of internalized this by telling myself that those fairy-tale stories were just illustrations to teach people the truth, and that naturally stories create for people of hundredths of years ago had to be different to 'work' than they would need to be now. Hence I never understood those who build their faith literally on the bible. (Or by extension to other holy texts in other faiths.)  


But where did this journey lead me? If I do \*not\* believe in most of the dogma presented by the Catholic church, and did \*not\* agree with a large extend of what its leaders did and preached, and did look with disgust on how very large groups of so-called Christians acted because of their faith... Why did or could I call myself Catholic still? So, without changing my denomination I more and more considered myself a Christian without church (while out of habit and cultural reasons still remaining Catholic.). But putting the dogma/teachings further back and back what remained? My strong belief in what I consider morally right and 'good' and a clear view on what I think the positive aspects of churches and religious groups are. However, I more and more realized: Where is god in this? Or rather, where is the *need* of a god in this? Given, that nobody has a proof of a god, that the 'good things' of religions could be achieved by humans just based on reason and humanity, but that a huge amount of really 'bad things' happen *because* of religion; why should one believe in a god? Or rather - why should one adjust ones life to the needs of a hypothetical being and even more so the *interpretation* of the will of a hypothetical being by humans with failures and other less pure motifs? And thus I became an atheist.   


I honestly don't think anymore that religions bring anything to the table that is positive. Yes, good things happen 'in the name of god' - but why shouldn't it be possible to have them happen regardless of a god? Do I need a higher being that judges me to do good? I don't think so. Does it mean that I deny the possibility of a higher being? No. But unless I get a reason to believe in one as a *fact* not as an *imaginary concept, however fitting it is* I will act as if it doesn't exist and I will definitely deny anybody trying to influence my life based on nothing but referring to fictional stories. Example: You think adultery is wrong? Maybe so, but if you want to convince me of it being morally wrong, then you have to do better than ""Because god says so"". (For reference, adultery is definitely wrong in my personal moral frame. I would feel wrong doing it, and I would feel wronged if loved ones would do it. But it is wrong for me because I made a personal vow to somebody, and I know that person's opinion and feeling about it. So I know I would hurt and destroy trust.)    


And this brings me back to ""preach the gospel in a less harmful way"". To me, the only way this can be achieved is by preaching without any reference to any supernatural or higher being. Without reference to any dogma or holy book that is seen as literal truth. The moment I postulate *anything* as the unchangeable truth which cannot be doubted or disagreed with, I open the door to the having it abused in the most horrific way.

(I was around 5 or 6 when this happened) She had two pigtails and every time I'd see her they were died a different color, up until the tie holding it together. The actual hair streaming out of the pig-tails was still the natural brown every time. She had a white dress that didn't attach to her hips at all, so basically like a horror movie doll. One day, she started talking about death, and I really didn't want to talk about it but I couldn't shut her voice out of my head. She started talking about methods of how one could kill themselves, and I really REALLY didn't want to think about it, so I finally started screaming and banging my head on the wall. I must have passed out, because the next thing I remember is being in a hospital bed. They couldn't figure out why I did it, and I had shown no evidence of suicidal thoughts before, so they just sent me home with some aspirin or something for the headache. But after that, when I tried to talk to her again, I couldn't. (Yes, I can ""wish"" them to talk to me, but most of the time they just pop up out of nowhere) I kept calling out to her for the next few days, but nothing, and then finally she appeared maybe a week after the ""incident"" and she had a rope around her neck. (Quite possibly the strangest thing, I didn't even know what a noose was, let alone that it was a way to kill yourself.) She started screaming less than a second after she appeared, and it got so loud that I squeezed my eyes shut and put my hands over my ears, and when she finally stopped and I opened my eyes, she wasn't there anymore. To this day if I try to bring her up or make her appear, she doesn't come.

---------|----------|----------|
Love it! What did you do before you got into the crypto space?|I'm operating punk4156 anonymously, so you'll have to excuse me if I don't get too specific here. I've spent the last 15 years engaged in different combinations of creative, tech, finance, and entrepreneurial ventures. I discovered Bitcoin in 2013 when a friend at one of those ventures mentioned that he 'thought it was too late for mining'. I said 'mining what?' and went home and started reading everything I could about Bitcoin. The rest was history.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv3614q/)
How does it feel?|I broke down and cried when I won the auction, that's how historically important this piece...oh, you want *that* answer...feels good man.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv363fa/)
Do you prefer to collect from established artists or try and bring smaller artists into the spotlight?|There's definitely a place for both. Non-fungible tokens will capture so many different kinds of value. I think we're currently seeing an interesting mix of a) people growing new brands around the new medium, and b) people importing existing brands into the new medium. IMO it's difficult to prefer one over the other without excluding yourself from a large set of opportunities. Eventually it will make sense to specialize, but it's so early.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv368gs/)
How did you get your start in crypto? I've followed you on Twitter for a month or so now and you've seemingly gained some notoriety pretty quickly, so I'm just curious about how you got started with it all.|See the answer above. Tl;dr worked in art, finance, and tech in various capacities, friend mentioned something called Bitcoin in 2013 and I fell down the rabbit hole.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv369hb/)
I love the 420 being there.|The other bidder had 380 ETH in their wallet, and I realized they were going to use it all. Once I got to 400, I had to do it. I didn't hesitate for a moment.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv35x76/)
I have seen you collect X-COPY Artworks. I am trying to grab the story behind it. Can you explain what pulls you towards XCOPYART ?|In my experience, most things that are worth doing with a lot of conviction, are worth doing for many different reasons at once. I think this is very true wrt collecting XCOPY's work. The work is simultaneously aesthetically amazing, and conceptually interesting, very historically important, authentic, native to the medium (as Pak said, 'you can't print out an XCOPY'), and also documenting crypto history. In some sense XCOPY \*is\* crypto art. I think he will be one of the most important artists of the movement, and the movement will be one of the most important cultural phenomena in the world. Which practically makes XCOPY the most important artist in the world. Nobody really sees this yet, but I think they will soon.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv36351/)
What do you look for when buying nft artwork on the secondary market?  ( Also love seeing your tweets - always interesting :D )|Is it conceptually interesting? Is it aesthetically pleasing? Is it historically important? Is the work native to the medium? Is it authentic? Is it in the top 1% of work? Is the artist a reasonable person? Are they likely to stick around long-term? Do they have what it takes to become world famous? Will other people want this? Am I the first to discover this? These are the kinds of questions I'm trying to ask myself. There's no perfect formula, but most pieces should satisfy most of these requirements before buying.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv36bhx/)
Thanks in advance for this AMA! Do you think Investing in NFT brings more returns than crypto? Would love to hear your comprehensive look on it!|There are almost definitely pieces that will outperform ETH, so I think a better question to ask is 'do you think investing in a portfolio of NFTs provides a better risk / reward than investing in ETH'. I think this is a really tough question to answer, and I think about it an awful lot. My best answer is probably 'not on average, but it depends on the portfolio...'. IMO it's nearly a certainty that ETH goes 10-50x in the next decade (not investment advice, don't invest more than you're willing to lose...). There are NFT pieces that will go 1000x in the same period, but can you find them? Are you willing to commit as much capital to them as you would to ETH itself? The main reason to be bullish on NFTs is probably the reason I'm doing what I'm doing, and Metakovan is doing what he's doing. At some point many of us in crypto will have more capital than we need in the real world, and investing it in digital cultural artifacts is a lot of fun.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv36blt/)
What makes **Genesis Pepe** worth that much?  What is your favorite cryptocurrency?  Why?|I'm very partial to Ethereum. I think Vitalik is a once-in-a-generation genius and that the community that has gathered around his project (now the internet's project) reflects his own kindness, intelligence, and long-term thinking.  The short answer for the Pepe, is that copies make originals more valuable (this is one of the reasons I love and foster 4156 as a meme), and that Pepe is the most copied and memed object in internet history. The Pepe genesis is, in the long run, not only worth 'that much', but worth 100s of times more. Nobody realizes this yet, but it is likely a priceless cultural artifact. Our generation's Mona Lisa.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv380m9/)
Being that your online personality revolves around punk4156, do you think you would ever sell it  if someone offers you a considerable sum of ETH?|While it's difficult to imagine doing that now, in my business life I typically get bored of things after 4 or 5 years, and move on to the next frontier. I'm not sure if that will happen this time, but if it does, it should coincide nicely with the NFT ecosystem maturing, and 4156 becoming something that could be owned by the entire community. So if I do eventually sell her, it could be to a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) or other form of community ownership.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv38kgy/)
This was a brilliant investment probably the most influential drawing in human cultural history.|This is making me cry again. I get nauseous even thinking about the responsibility of owning it. I will never understand, but always be grateful for this opportunity.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv39fll/)
Why did that cost 1 million?|The real question, with nothing but respect for Matt, is why didn't it cost 100 million? So help me I will make sure he realizes some of that value in my lifetime.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv3c7gc/)

---------|----------|----------|
Can you make sounds like: k,sh,t,p,f ? Because these dont use vocal cords, its just air coming out and the tongue moving right?|Yes! I can make those sounds, I typically use “tsch” to get people’s attention when I want to interact with them|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2gmnq/)
can you make like whispery sounds|No, I have complete vocal cord paralysis, meaning I can’t make vocal sounds. But I do understand your thought process!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2e5em/)
How'd your parents figure out about it?  I imagine in some scenarios folks would get worried simply because the child couldn't speak.|Well the doctors thought I was dead when I was born so that should clear it up lol|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2dkun/)
What are some signs that everyone should know that would help mute people out in day-to-day life?|Definitely what u/The_Greate_Pickle commented, if the ASL alphabet was part of standardized learning, it would help more than just mute people|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2e8az/)
Have you found any silver linings related to your condition? For example, many abled people feel rushed or pressured into communicating without thinking when they need to talk, but someone unable to may have the opportunity to think before they speak, thus feeling less pressure as a result of their condition. Do you find that to be true for you, and are there other such (seeming) advantages you've discovered?|I feel that’s true yes, though my condition doesn’t really make me feel excluded or depressed about life, other things do that lol|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2g3wi/)
Wait what happends when ur laughting  like do u make the sound or not ?|I do make a sound, though it’s mostly just breathy airy nothingness lol|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2rqxt/)
Do you have an inner voice? How does it sound like?  Is there any operation that can make you be able to speak? Have you thought about doing the operation?|Yes I have an inner voice, and it’s my moms, because it’s the most comforting and familiar. But there’s always a surgery for anything, though my condition would require a very expensive and highly experimental/potentially fatal, so I think I’ll stick with being mute for now lol|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2w8av/)
I can't imagine bawling my eyes out without making a sound. What's it like for you to cry/sob?|Mostly just sniffling and tearing up|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2nv9r/)
What's the best part about being mute?|I don’t have to make phone calls|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2omyq/)
I came from the other post, what is the primary way you speak to people, do you use sign with your parents? What other methods of communication do you use from day to day?|Mainly I keep to myself as I don’t really leave my house unless it’s for work, I prefer to communicate with people with ASL, but if they don’t know it, I just use my phone to type what I want to say.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2a9lh/)
Born mute? What does it mean?|I was born with vocal cord paralysis, meaning I can’t speak|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv29tkr/)
Are you able to make noise at all, or is it completely inability to make noise|Noises like whistling I can still do, just not like humming or anything to do with a “voice”|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2cm1m/)
How have you overcome the stereotypical means of forming relationships such as family, friendships, workplace and SO's without vocal communication?|Using my phone to communicate with those who don’t know ASL|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2cub5/)
How are you finding the string of ""silence is violence"" memes?|Honestly I’m fairly certain I started tjem lol|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2m5bw/)
Hey! First of all thank you for doing this!   I hope this isn't really a bad question, but I'm asking because this is something I'm thinking of lately! So I hope it makes sense!  If one of your friends learned sign language so they could communicate with you without using phones or paper and so on, would you think of it as a nice gesture, or would you find it a bit odd?  And one more thing! Do you think it's easier for you to communicate with people because of technology today rather than if you were to need to keep a pen and paper on you? I feel like it helps, but I'm not sure why other than that it saves time, so are there other ways it facilitates things for you?  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks a lot in advance! Have a lovely day!|It isn’t odd to learn a new language to speak with others is it? Same is applied to ASL! And yeah having a phone is so much easier than pen and paper|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2mbrl/)
Is there some kind of surgery you could undergo to improve the vocal situation? If there was, would you even want to do it?|I’m sure there is but I’m also certain it’s highly experimental and dangerous, not to mention the expense.. I’d stick with being mute|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2pidk/)
Have you seen bowling for colombine before? Great documentary|I have not!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2pqlv/)
Does it bother you being mute? You seem to talk about it quite easily, it it just something you're used to now and can live with, or do you feel like it sucks?|Well you can’t really miss/mourn for something you’ve never had, so it’s just life for me :3|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2q0zp/)
What does it feel like?|Well that’s a broad question, lol, I suppose it feels like anything else would|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv337cs/)
Then how did you make this post ? I suspect you’re lying.|Uhh what?|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv3atym/)

Amusingly enough, some Christian denominations would say he'd still be going to Heaven, as long as he was saved and baptized before he started his crime spree (Bible Baptists, I'm looking at you here!). I personally don't think that, but that's more because the theoretical murderer caused harm to people (him/her self and others), which is my personal definition of ""sin"".

OP, on the other hand, isn't harming anyone through his actions or beliefs. The beliefs given to him by other people as he was growing up (which is the literal definition of [indoctrination](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/indoctrination), by the way, but because it's *our* society doing it to *our* children, it's fine. Other societies teaching *their* values to *their* children are wrong, though, unless of course they have the same values and beliefs that we do. How does that even make sense?) are causing him mental anguish. So who's being sinned against here?

&gt; But like I said, take religion out of it, incest is still not okay.

What's your definition of ""incest""? What causes it to be ""wrong""? As I said in my other response to you, to me the only thing wrong about incest is when there's a distinct possibility of genetic reinforcement of a bad gene, causing mental or physical defects in any children. Since OP is practicing safe sex, then that doesn't come into play, so there's nothing wrong about their relationship.

Before you point out that it's ""immoral"", let me mention that morals are simply a set of guidelines that a society has agreed upon to attempt to show people how they should behave toward one another, there's nothing ""natural"" about them. They're a learned set of behaviors, nothing more. They *are* important, don't misunderstand me, because they teach us how we **should** behave toward one another. But they also shouldn't be used to control people. That's what laws are for, and I've already pointed out the issue I have with most ""incest"" laws in the United States.",,,1618845899,{},gv3a27p,False,t3_mtsq4s,False,True,t1_gv2xmhq,/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv3a27p/,1618847619,1,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],,

There are multiple definitions of atheism. Most atheists define it as ""lack of belief in a god"" (this is the minimum requirement to be an atheist), some goes a step further and say ""I believe there is no god"" and then even fewer says ""There are no god(s)"".

Alot of theists like to define it as: ""There definately are no gods!"", because that is an easier definition to argue against, making them seem less irrational in contrast.

I am an agnostic atheist, and I don't know whether or not there is a god, but i believe there are no gods.

Do you also wonder if you are wrong about not believing in Allah? or Vishnu? or Thor? Do you fear hell in their respective religions?

---------|----------|----------|
For me, it was a soda with caffeine. End result, is the same.  Does this happen to you often that you’re up all night?|No never. It’s only happened one other time and that was when I accidentally took a pain medication with caffeine in it before bed|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtv676/decided_it_would_be_a_good_idea_to_drink_coffee/gv21fft/)
Im envious that coffee works for you even though it looks like you're screwed|Here’s the thing. Coffee doesn’t work for me during the day. It doesn’t give me energy at all. So I wrongly assumed it would be the same thing at night.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtv676/decided_it_would_be_a_good_idea_to_drink_coffee/gv231r3/)
Watching your phone screen will definitely *not* help. It's as powerful a sleep prevention as all the coffee...|Dad is that you? Lol I’m kidding I know I should get off but I just can’t sleep and I don’t like to be alone with my thoughts for too long|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtv676/decided_it_would_be_a_good_idea_to_drink_coffee/gv27w4e/)
Bet you won’t do that again, right? I feel your pain. My wife suggested drinking tea before bed. It didn’t dawn on me initially why I was having trouble falling asleep until I realized that the caffeine in the tea was keeping me up. No more tea for me before bed!|You are absolutely right I will never do that again. Also yeah some teas have caffeine in them but some actually don’t and there are some that are made especially for sleep so maybe try those!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtv676/decided_it_would_be_a_good_idea_to_drink_coffee/gv2fxch/)
Did you fall asleep yet?|Lol I was finally able to go to sleep at around 3 am|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtv676/decided_it_would_be_a_good_idea_to_drink_coffee/gv2n1gc/)
I have insomnia and cannot get to sleep anyway, I'll stay up too. How did the night go?|Not too bad! I finally went to sleep around three am which means I got around 5 hours of sleep. Not too bad but not ideal I guess|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtv676/decided_it_would_be_a_good_idea_to_drink_coffee/gv2t7rp/)
Why would you drink coffee before bed lol?|1. It doesn’t give me extra energy if I drink it during the day so I foolishly assumed it wouldn’t do anything 2. I’m not the best decision make|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtv676/decided_it_would_be_a_good_idea_to_drink_coffee/gv24qzh/)
What kind of coffee? Single origin or blend? What's your favorite region?|Umm cold brew? With lots of milk and some creamer. I’m just starting to like coffee so I don’t drink too much of it. I think it’s Columbian though|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtv676/decided_it_would_be_a_good_idea_to_drink_coffee/gv24wq0/)
Any plans for tomorrow? Not being able to sleep the night before a big day is shit|I have to wake up at 8 for my class at 9 then I have an hour to shower and get ready before my class at 11 and then work from 12:30 to 6. I also have a test and an essay due tomorrow  so basically I’m screwed|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtv676/decided_it_would_be_a_good_idea_to_drink_coffee/gv22a3q/)
You ever drink so much coffee your lungs hurt?|I didn’t know that was possible!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtv676/decided_it_would_be_a_good_idea_to_drink_coffee/gv2l6bv/)
Are you still awake?|Lol I was finally able to go to sleep at around 3 am which means I got around 5 hours of sleep. Not too bad but not good either|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtv676/decided_it_would_be_a_good_idea_to_drink_coffee/gv2pwll/)
lol no sleep for you, you considered switching to decaf?|I’ve considered it especially since I have ADD but I just haven’t done it yet|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtv676/decided_it_would_be_a_good_idea_to_drink_coffee/gv2pyr1/)

And one more thing! Do you think it's easier for you to communicate with people because of technology today rather than if you were to need to keep a pen and paper on you?

First of all, neurodivergence is worth taking into consideration. There are many people who feel like their neurodivergence in some way affects their gender, which is a big portion of people with xenogenders. This might seem like 'making their neurodivergence their whole identity', but a lot of people don't understand how being ND can often affect the entire way your brain works and how you view yourself. So it makes perfect sense to me how it could affect gender identity for an individual; I'm autistic and that definitely has *some* influence on it for me.

&gt;I feel like that's relating to an animal, and animals aren't genders.

The color pale lemon yellow and the letter e are inexplicably tied to my gender (might be my mild synesthesia, which is another example of how being ND could influence it tbh) so I don't find it utterly wild that someone could tie their gender with an animal.

Which sounds so terrible but if you get emotionally involved in calls you'll get too fucked up to actually be helpful. I've given CPR more times than I can remember and it doesn't phase me at all. The calls that are most memorable are the ones that were hilarious, your first calls of a certain type, OR more likely the ones so terrible you can't forget them despite your best effort. I'll give you new examples of each.

First let's do a first. The first time I had to talk someone through delivering their own child was a big deal to me. They're rare calls because most people make it to the hospital before that point. But i took a call, wife having her second or third child. I ask the how far along and how far apart are contractions. Over 35weeks and 30 seconds apart. Baby is coming. Dad is busy holding the other kids so he puts me on speaker phone so I can talk to his sister-in-law/wife's sister who is getting ready to catch. We actually have scripts to assist us but I'd never used it other than in training. I remember feeling panic that I was going to make a mistake and trying to not laugh as I read the word vagina over and over as well as saying ""be careful not to drop the baby they are slippery"".  Baby was born healthy and I actually got to meet her years later. Apparently they knew a fireman who I work with and got a copy of the call. I was told they play it on her birthday every year. And they got me some nice thank you gifts.

A fucked up one. A 20 something kid took too much heroin and has overdosed. His mom calls for medics but by default we also send police because our officers are already mobile and carry Narcan. Officer arrives and she refuses to answer the door because she was also doing drugs and didn't want to get arrested. She's yelling at me for sending ""the fucking cops"" and I'm desperately trying to get her to understand the officer has narcan and it's what your son needs. She still refuses so officers break the door down and try to administer narcan, but it's too late. Her son died as she actively prevented him from getting help for several minutes so that she wouldn't get arrested.

And let's end on a happier note. This one I was dispatching I didn't take the call. It's a welfare check on a subject walking on the interstate. White female, long hair, topless. I put the call out and every available officer in that city marked enroute. First unit on scene keys up and advises it's actually going to be a heavyset shirtless male with long hair.

Uh, that's a very good one. Honestly, it seems so simple now, but learning about the differences between holistic and individualistic cultures made alot of the world make much better sense. 


For those who do not know holistic cultures are very group-oriented. The role an individual plays in a family, or a group is often a main priority and can superseed the individuals wants. 
Whereas the individualistic cultures are as we know them in the west, focused on the individual gain. 


There are of cause nuances all over the world, but those two templates made me understand the cultures clashes in my own country alot more and gave me a new perspective which I believe could be to the betterment of all if taught properly.

Question | Answer | Link
---------|----------|----------|
Do your parents know?|No, they haven't found out. Although there have been some close calls.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv1ny79/)
Do you use protection when you have sex?  Is she on BC?|I use protection when we get intimate, but she currently isn't on birth control so we don't do it very often. We both know how disastrous it could be if she got pregnant.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv1rtzs/)
Are you afraid of social stigmatization?|Very much so. It gave me depression for a while thinking of how people would view us.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv1o6d9/)
Is she the first girl you’ve been with?  Has she been with anybody before?|I had a few girlfriends through high school but never really went past second base, the most intimate thing I had done before was with hands.  She had one boyfriend freshman year, but it was a typical early high school thing and didn't go past hugging and kissing.  So yes before it's asked, we took each other's virginity.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv1rxdy/)
How do you think you’re parents will react?|Our hope is they never find out, but we know it will most likely happen at some point, its unreasonable to assume that they could be oblivious forever.  If they found out now, I think I would probably be forcibly separated from her and kicked out, with college funding cut off.  If they find out when we are moved out and done with school, it would still suck as they'd cut all ties most likely, but they couldn't really do much at that point.  It's still scary to think of though as they are very religious and conservative, and I know they would disapprove.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv1s6jn/)
Do you love her?|Yes, with all my heart.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv1npga/)
Do you still believe in God?|Yes.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv1ox48/)
Do you live in the USA?|Yes.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv1srtw/)
Have you had anal sex?|We tried once, but she wasn't into it.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv1tq5j/)
Were you with other lovers before each other, you know like sexually?|I had a few girlfriends, but I was never intimate with them. She had one boyfriend when she was 15, but it was a typical high school thing and was short-lived.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv1ovbc/)
Do you have part time jobs? Are you saving a nest egg for worst-case scenarios?|This is gonna be my last answer for the night, will do more in the morning.  She's currently working as a cashier in a local fast food joint. I work part-time at a mechanic shop that my best-friends dad owns. We have been saving up a portion of each of our paychecks when possible for the past year or so. We have enough to get by if things went south.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv1ulmq/)

Funniest job would be when I was a regular officer, prior to joining firearms. We got a call out about somebody seeing a major drug deal going on in the alleys behind their house which very very swiftly turned out to be... Two teenagers trading about a gram and a half of marijuana. Gave them a caution and confiscated the stuff and tried not to laugh in front of them for professionalism. Most awful job I'd rather not discuss in a public comment because it feels disrespectful, but there's always a few.

[],,MrPulsar_Original,,,[],,,,text,t2_119v1e,False,False,[],"So when I was 15 I remember seeing one of my best friends in high school talk about drinking cough syrup. Two of my best friend actually and it was so bizarre. Back in 2005-2006 that was like, whoa, taboo subject. And so I naturally freaked out on them and even almost felt like snitching them out. Then at this local event one of my friends had gotten into a car accident and had some Vicodin and he was just like so freaking happy and different it honestly threw me off more because he was just so happy to be talking with people when he is usually a quiet nerd like me. But he also started to believe 9/11 conspiracies and stuff around this time and it gave me this weird feeling that if I started taking drugs I would end up thinking stuff like that. But I love that guy, platonically, still and I know he got help but his story is not mine to tell or reveal.

A year after that I had my wisdom tooth operation and when I woke up from it I was all doped up from the operation. One of my parents told me on the way home, “Wow you are being really nice to me! We gotta keep you on that stuff” (jokingly of course, referring to the drug). I’m certain I had untreated ADD growing up. 

But up until that point I never liked drugs and were frankly frightened of them. I actually didn’t try weed until I had basically tried most hard drugs. Opioids were the only one I got hooked on though, I think that’s worth nothing. Meth is just stupid for me, it’s a little too intense and it just makes me have to Pee and drink a lot of water. Adderall is great though and it calms me down so much. I can sleep on it sometimes in the morning, it’s crazy. 

But yeah I definitely think if I had been more careful after my wisdom tooth operation I could have avoided that, maybe. I think in some ways I was likely to experiment with drugs just because of other things in life, given how positively I responded to opiates at just 16.

Another tip is to look at classical numbers, those peices are great for learning some technique although its optional if you just wanna have fun. And final thing (i promise) is to sightread music.
