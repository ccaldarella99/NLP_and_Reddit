I hooked it up to a door knob as instructed and before putting any weight on it I decided it looked too flimsy to be effective.  So using my hand I gently pushed down on it to test it and one of the elastics snapped.

Hmm let's see,

-beaten with a belt whenever I disobeyed, didn't follow rules, anything I did that made her mad, including bad grades and lying.  Not allowed to play with the neighbors kids when she was not home (she was a single mom working a 9-5 job until I was 12 so I was always home alone so of course I went to play with the other kids, the other kids would also come to the door and coax me out to play) she would come home, find out chase me and then whip me with a belt.

-forced to eat soap when lying or had jalapenos rubbed on my mouth

-purity culture

-called names: pig, fat, lazy, my bio dad's name as an insult
Along with squeezing my stomach and laughing, asking me why I don't workout, telling me I should workout or should lose weight (I actually became anorexic my junior year of highschool as a slow suicide and it would've worked if my counselor hadn't intervened). 

-searching my room to steal and snoop through my journals and then crying and lecturing me (with my stepdad) about how awful it was that I called her a bitch and that I hated her in pen)

-taking my phone away

-hiding the house phones so I couldn't talk to anyone or my boyfriend for weeks at a time

-hitting/throwing stuff/ yelling at me when she found out I had sex for the first time

-hitting me everytime someone got child services involved (they never did anything to help me)

-whenever we had a screaming match and I started to hyperventilate my stepdad would pin me to the ground and not let me up

-same step dad also never really intervened to get her to stop or tell her what she was doing was wrong.

-coming into my room while I'm practicing tracing and ripping apart my drawings and then telling at me for not doing math or science.

-stepdad telling me that (at this rate because I struggled with school) my only chance for success would be to marry a man with money and hope he can take care of me

-same step dad telling me that sending panty/bra pics to my boyfriend was like taunting a dog with raw meat

-not helping fund college because they didn't think I would keep up with it and that the money would be wasted

-not believing me when I told them I couldn't get financial aid until I was 23 because my step dad made too much money  

Stepdad comparing his situation financially and how he managed to fund himself debt free all the way to grad school and that I wasn't trying hard enough (I made 7.25 an hour at age 18 in a grocery store not to mention my mother wanted me to pay $300 for rent, if I was lucky I would make $400 every two weeks)

-threatening to put my head in the toilet (only reason it didn't happen was because her mother who was visiting at the time stopped her, I was like 5 or 6)

So essentially, on the weekends he'd go out with his buddies to a local bar and get absolutely shitfaced. On one particular weekend he was on his way back to the base in a cab and he puked all over the inside of the car, and after cleaning up his mess and making it to the base he crawled all the way to his room, but he was caught by a guard while crawling up the stairs. The guard asked him if he was alright and he obviously said no, so he was carried all the way up to his room, taken to the bathroom, and spent the rest of the night puking into a toilet.

Another good one is when the pilot of the plane he was on literally made a pit stop in Ireland to visit his girlfriend under the pretense of ""needing emergency repairs,"" so they were stuck there for three days.

You are absolutely right about the love and care they took with every scene of the film. Everything from direction, acting, art/set/costume/etc. was top notch and it was visually stunning. Music and score too.

I think the plot lines of DiCaprio's decline and Pitt's run in with the Manson family did not match up at all and the overall pacing was just off to me. It felt to me like a very incoherent mashup of a variety of Hollywood scenes and gags, which as I write this I realize might have been part of the whole point of the film?

When I watch something like Django, I think of the how Tarantino plays with tension throughout the entire Candy Land sequence. Constantly building tension, then loosening its grip only to squeeze harder and harder over and over until you finally get that gun shot from Dr. Shultz finally releasing it all in one singular moment. None of that skill is shown off in Once Upon A Time at all because it is so disjointed to me. That is not to say that Once Upon A Time needed to have that same energy or emotion; it is a very different emotional space from any of Tarantino's other films imo. There just seemed to be a lack of any cohesion in the film from scene to scene or in any of the characters outside of DiCaprio and Pitt. Everything seemed confusing and just really off. 

I am sure I had a very emotional reaction to all of that when I first saw it. I had very high expectations of Once Upon A Time In Hollywood and I hope that when I revisit it I can see it in a better light. Thanks again for sharing with me! Cheers!

Doesnt matter that you smile and speak in a pleasant tone of voice. You are actively going out of your way to prevent an employee from doing their (only) assigned task and putting them in an uncomfortable situation with their employer. 

A prime example: my retail shop has a clear sign saying mask required for entry. I have a regular who is generally a super sweet lady that I've helped for 2 years now. But ever since covid she comes in every week without a mask, no matter how many times we provide her with and ask her to wear one. Yea shes polite and pleasant to interact with outside of that, but shes still being selfish and inconsiderate of me trying to do my job in the manner my company expects and I've lost respect for her as a result. If break the rules for one customer, regardless of how nice they are, then I open myself up to more customers trying to take advantage. 
Same goes for IDs. I check IDs on every single guest because that's what I've been instructed to do. Idgaf if your 60 and have grey hair. You can give me your ID at the register, or you can go home with nothing. Yea I could override the ID scanner for someone who's clearly an adult, but my employer doesnt like when we do that and the second I let it slide once, the customer will continue to come with no ID until I begin to refuse sales. 

It is a matter of consistency.

I never understood why her teacher didn't correct her.

He had been a big, twitchy guy with veiny skin stretched over swollen biceps, a tattoo of a swastika on his tongue. Teeth filed into razor-sharp fangs-you know the type. And you’re chopping off his head because, even with eight bullet holes in him, you’re pretty sure he’s about to spring back to his feet and eat the look of terror right off your face.

On the follow-through of the last swing, though, the handle of the ax snaps in a spray of splinters. You now have a broken ax. So, after a long night of looking for a place to dump the man and his head, you take a trip into town with your ax. You go to the hardware store, explaining away the dark reddish stains on the broken handle as barbecue sauce. You walk out with a brand-new handle for your ax.

The repaired ax sits undisturbed in your garage until the spring when, on one rainy morning, you find in your kitchen a creature that appears to be a foot-long slug with a bulging egg sac on its tail. Its jaws bite one of your forks in half with what seems like very little effort. You grab your trusty ax and chop the thing into several pieces. On the last blow, however, the ax strikes a metal leg of the overturned kitchen table and chips out a notch right in the middle of the blade.

Of course, a chipped head means yet another trip to the hardware store. They sell you a brand-new head for your ax. As soon as you get home, you meet the reanimated body of the guy you beheaded earlier. He’s also got a new head, stitched on with what looks like plastic weed-trimmer line, and it’s wearing that unique expression of “you’re the man who killed me last winter” resentment that one so rarely encounters in everyday life.

You brandish your ax. The guy takes a long look at the weapon with his squishy, rotting eyes and in a gargly voice he screams, “That’s the same ax that beheaded me!”
