[],,halsoy,,,[],,,,text,t2_d0kok,False,False,[],"I've had the pleasure and discomfort of trying out a fairly wide selection of toys. My mileage might not be the same as others, as I'm on the upper portion girth wise. Which just means it's more of a challenge to find toys that actually do anything. Fleshlights work, but certain other alternatives are too narrow/tight, so the lube gets pushed out and the end result is kinda like dry fucking. Not nice. 

The answer is in general that you don't really feel individual shapes. You do however feel texture differences. So like right now I'm using a couple Tenga versions, tenga spinners to be exact. They are a bit too tight, but they are borderline. They have textures that varies much like how fleshlights (and other alternatives) do, but with an added bonus of a plastic coil that literally spins the masturbator as you move it.

This helps stimulate the entire head and shaft a bit more, and you can get varying feels from stroke to stroke.

The actual sensation is kinda like how if you lay in bed and you touch yourself. You can vary the sensation by number of fingers, spacing between then, the pressure you apply, what type of motion and how you move your body in relation to the touch. Much like how your fingers can do two, three or more things at the same time, pulsing, vibrating, squeezing or just gently stroking your body, the patterns in the sleeves will apply different pressures. Touch different parts of the penis in different ways and have different sensations of motion depending on contact area.

Some patterns will tease the head to the point of cuming almost instantly, while others will grip the shaft so tight it acts like suction, making the penis super stiff and sensitive. 

The experience is just different, not really more fulfilling. You can have some that feels like a really, really wet blowjob, others will feel like hands gripping you tight. Others feel like just a super wet pussy you just want to fuck, and fuck and fuck. Just like how with a partner you get different moods and desires, so are the different shapes and sensations of masturbation sleeves. The major difference to me is that with an actual partner, a loving body, you get all sleeves in one package. But with a much more whole and fulfilling experience. I mean, I feel kinda stupid when I slap my sleeves and shout ""ride me hard!"" to my hands :p

Arthur says ""what do you get if you cross a mentally ill person with a society that treats him like crap? You get what you fucking deserve"" then shoots Murray in the head. That's the focal point of the film, what it's all been leading to.

The majority of the film is dedicated to three things: Arthur's mental health (the hallucinations, the suicidality, his laughing condition), the way he's treated (the assaults, Thomas Wayne, his colleagues, his mother, Murray), and systemic issues (underfunding healthcare providers, poverty, privilege). There isn't one specific thing that makes him Joker, there's a lot of little ones.

Abuse and poverty drive some people to do awful things, that's just a fact. The movie also treats mental illness as one of those things. That's the justification he gives Murray when he kills him along with the abuse and poverty.

There are hundreds of people in the film who have been the victim of systemic problems who start rioting with that as their motivator. That to me indicates that the film is trying to make a point about wider issues. Arthur's experience with poverty is the rallying cry to them. But since the film doesn't pay attention to the people who are hurt by this, or who don't participate in the violence we're supposed to assume that these people are representative.

My issue is that the film also neglects to show or even mention mental illness and abuse victims who don't go to the same place as Arthur. It seems to be saying that the reason we should pay attention to these people is because they're dangerous rather than some altruistic motive. That could have the opposite effect, making people say ""look at what these awful people are doing, screw them"" so I don't think it contributes something good to mental health discussion.

I haven't seen Forrest Gump so I can't comment but I'm guessing it does mention how difficult it can be to live with a disability? And the fact that he prospers  is showing that people can live good lives with support? That seems to be the opposite message to this film.

You're correct that the film can also be interpreted as a character study, a film specifically about one individual. In fact that's the lens that I think the film works best with and the one through which I view it in order to enjoy it. I like the idea of showing a comic book character in a gritty real world setting. I enjoyed the movie because I'm a fan of the Joker in other mediums.

I would look into getting a refund yourself as I literally have a degree in economics and have studied pre-industrial economics extensively in my undergrad, particularly population dynamics

&gt;my point was about transportation… there were some big breakthroughs in shipping which facilitated huge economic gains around the 16th century

Youre absolutely right, the Fluyt was a huge innovation in pre-industrial Europe. However, you missed a couple key points of information. 1) Mansa Musa died in 1337, 2) he lived Saharan Africa, 3) boats don’t go on land. Maybe you’re saying that the term pre-industrial isn’t a catch all term. I agree with that. However, for this particular conversation, it is more appropriate to refer to them as a preindustrialized economy because the factors were talking about right now were still true in preindustrial societies up until just recently. I also, unlike you, didn’t make any leap of logic assertions that were purely speculative without any sort of citation. I stated general truths, and how any rational person would’ve reacted. All I asked for was a source and who performed the original economic analysis because I could see flaws in their basic argument. As an expert in transportation, you agree that labor couldnt have redistributed itself easily in 1300s Egypt, right? You agree that if labor was to redistribute itself, it likely wouldn’t have gone from Cairo to Timbuktu, right? You agree that a rug shop in Mecca becoming unprofitable isn’t going to pack up and sail to Goa, right?

Pay attention to yr partner. Ask them what feels good, if they like what yr doing. See if they respond to different things, but don’t get so focused on switching it up that they can’t get into a groove. 

Talk to them after, ask if it was better when you did a or b. Sometimes it’s hard to talk when yr in the middle of everything. It’s ok if they can’t give an answer right then, they’ll know you’re trying to figure out what they like, &amp; remember for the future. They’ll be able to say something simple like, “don’t stop doing that, that’s perfect”, etc. 

Women can have a harder time getting comfy &amp; relaxed, sometimes. So we have to make sure we don’t make that more difficult. Make things easier for them; massage them during foreplay, make them feel like this is something for the both of you, not just that she’s a human flashlight. 

Sometimes yr with someone who has a hard time communicating. Then you have to pay attention to all the non-verbal cues. What’s she doing w her hands, her body, her eyes, her mouth?  

Also, everyone is different. That thing yr ex really loved? Yr new pal might not be into, at all. Or vice versa. Example-I love to eat pussy. I’m good at it, I think. Most of my exes have been gung ho abt it. But one long term gf didn’t like it at all, she was insecure abt her body &amp; it was too intimate for her. So I just didn’t do that w her.

[],,Artupoint,,,[],,,,text,t2_axegln0p,False,False,[],"&gt;I’m guessing smaller dildos are a gateway towards larger and larger ones and soon smaller sized ones just aren't enough. Many girls will have skewed expectations of the size of what most human penises are before they have ever had the real thing.

There’s no “gateway” theory to dildos and vaginas. Maybe younger girls start out with something smaller, but most women do not gradually go up in the girth/length of a dildo beyond what the normal size is of an average human penis. If you go on sites that sell sex toys, you’ll see a normal sized dildo that’s as close to the real thing is the most common product and also the most sold product. 

&gt;The worst kind of sex is when they just lay there and wait for you to finish. There is nothing more soul destroying than that. (been there once and was no fun). 

Not to invalidate your experience, but I’d be glad that was a one time thing. Not all women engage in sex that way. You probably didn’t have good sexual chemistry with this person or perhaps she didn’t really enjoy sex in general, or a combination of both. 

&gt;I can't be the only one that feels the same way. I think it's sad for men, but also sad for women too if they are gradually training themselves to be unable to find satisfaction from 99% of penises.

Very few women are “size queens” that prefer to be penetrated by huge dildos/penises. Most women want average size. Again, most aren’t gradually expanding on the size of our sex toys until they are larger than the average penis. 

If there is one drawback to using sex toys, it comes from using vibrators. Sometimes women will make their nerve endings desensitized by using vibrators that are too strong, like those Hitachi wands. Or you will come across women who can only achieve orgasm through a vibrator. This isn’t so widespread though that you’ll have such a hard time finding a woman who can enjoy sex without a vibrator.",,,1620054225,{},gwsgfb5,False,t3_n3lp2x,False,True,t1_gwse3lz,/r/AskReddit/comments/n3lp2x/what_nsfw_question_have_you_always_wanted_to_ask/gwsgfb5/,1620084624,1,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

The biggest thing(IMO) that drives this dynamic to the worse is _you trying to be seen,_ if that makes sense.

Doing stuff because you enjoy it, regardless of who sees it, that's the ticket. Again, not easy to toe that line, especially if someone doesn't see you a lot - that kind of impression is very hard deliberately to make on someone. 

For reference, I'm a skier, and very good at it. It's easy to come off as a big-headed idiot in that sport, there's a whole game dedicated to doing just that - but unless I'm with a group that is playing that game, I don't care if someone sees me or not.
I will ski difficult, visible terrain, that sometimes has a crowd watching, but I'm not making a spectacle of it. I'm not recording my skiing, but if someone is asking to, I'll gladly accept, and be proud of the results. I'm also not scared of sharing footage of me eating absolute shit, and I will make fun of myself for it.

Of course. We contend this is a matter of faith.

&gt;If there was any definitive proof that he performed his miracles then every single christian would be touting it as definitve proof, it would be known across the world. But there is no proof.

Again, no one is saying the claims of Christianity are *proven*. But the *evidence* is there, and it's very compelling. Certainly good enough to entered into a jury trial, for instance.

&gt;Why are you just focused on Jesus of Nazareth? Because there are other things/people that we know 100% to have been real but also have similar mystical claims about them.

Because the evidence that he was/is the promised Jewish messiah and God incarnate is again very compelling. There are other claims made about other mystical figures, but none so good as those made about Jesus.

&gt;Why is it that you believe in Jesus' deeds and not his when they are both undeniably real historical figures that founded religions.

Jesus never wrote a single word in his defense. He never sought fame, wealth, or conquest. He merely took action, and others realized who he was. And when asked whether he was God and Messiah, he simply affired it.

&gt;Or what about the Temple of Asclepius in Greece? A holy site dedicated to the God of Healing and Son of Apollo Asclepius.

Jesus isn't revered because he healed people. He is revered because he fulfilled hundreds of prophecies about the promised Messiah, and he rose from the dead, proving his divinity.

&gt; But i think this is a pretty simple thing to explain, people are complex and sometimes have unshaking beliefs in things.

People will die for something they think is the truth. But they won't die for something they know is a lie. The earliest Christians claimed to have seen a risen Christ. Why lie about that, if the result was persecution?

&gt; Like, people will go on pilgrimages or see holy sites and describe it as overwhelming and they really felt god(s). 

Experiencing the Holy Spirit is not simply a ""good feeling"". It is not overwhelming. It doesn't make me ""happy"". For me, it has brought a real transcendent *peace* and *comfort*. Happiness is fleeting. Peace remains.

&gt;My point was that you cant just fill in the blanks with god, because it is much more likely that we simply have yet to figure it out.

I'm not trying to make a ""God in the gaps"" argument. I contend that science will *never* be able to answer the metaphysical questions I mentioned, because they defy scientific method. I learned through studying my faith that if I truly accepted Christ, I would find peace. Well, that happened, to me and countless others. If that same faith answers the question ""What happens to 'me' when I die"", then I accept the answer, knowing that science will continue to say ""We don't know"".

&gt;It took billions upon billions of years for the planet earth just to form, by chance, because a bunch of space dust gathered near a star. Then it took BILLIONS of years for life to form, it is literally incomprehensible how long it took. 

This is my point though. Despite the time it took, nature does not actually tend toward coalescence and order; it tends toward chaos and heat death. Yet we seen order, form, and function. We see the structure of DNA as not a lucky, accidental organization of proteins, but rather something that looks like a *programming language* for building living things. To my engineering mind, the universe does not look accidental. It looks *designed*.

&gt;Plato's religious morality paradox

If I read him correctly, he is saying none of is truly ""good"", because we only behave well enough to please our god or gods.

The Christian worldview goes in another direction. It contends that we are all actually ""evil"", that we have a sinful, self-serving nature. We don't see God as threatening us with punishment if we don't obey. Rather, we see him as our *Savior* from our own sinful acts. So when we act morally is it out of obedient *love*. We choose to love God and our neighbors as ourselves, because we are grateful to God for our present life, and for the eternal life to come. We see God as a loving Father, who wants to give good gifts to his children, not as some sort of tyrant.",,,1620054119,{},gwsg6wj,False,t3_n2fin8,False,False,t1_gwposag,/r/AskReddit/comments/n2fin8/what_question_do_you_have_that_nobody_has_been/gwsg6wj/,1620084492,1,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

He tells me the guy came in to buy white paint to touch up his window ledges. He asked if I still worked there, boss said no. He tells him, well, she was right about that dark colour.

Something about telling this one guy that it’s not cool to corner a younger female, pull out a knife, and say vague (but still obviously) threatening things, didn’t seem to be something he was willing to change (or acknowledge as wrong, even when he was seeking validation by telling the story).

Another guy didn’t understand why violently attacking his sister was unacceptable.  He also refused to stop being friends with Mr Knife despite multiple issues with different females over the years.

Another guy moved from being a marijuana drug runner/dealer to crack and such, and I didn’t want to be present for the inevitable police interaction.  He was really nice though, but also maintained his friendship with Mr Knife.

&amp;nbsp;

There were less severely problematic guys too, like one who refused to call me by anything that wasn’t a homophobic slur, and couldn’t stop lying about things.  Or a couple boys who were having a crisis of faith and looking for help with their underage drinking and driving (I didn’t want to be a casualty in their recklessness).

* Slavery was morally wrong and the primary reason we fought the civil war was to end the question of whether we were going to be a slaveholding republic or not. I know, I know, I know. But listen.... the framing of the question is the what causes people to get hung up about this. The South fought the war to defend slavery. The North fought to defend the union. Half the country had already decided slavery was morally untenable. The other half was wedded to it economically and the elites (who owned by far the most slaves) wouldn't give it up without a fight. We fought. The side that wasn't in favor of owning people won. That's moral progress and a step forward toward being more noble as a country.

* While the primary reason that Union soldiers gave for fighting was ""to preserve the Union"" - a substantial percentage of Union soldiers do indicate in the historical records that they were happy to help free black slaves and end slavery. There was a significant element of this present. Not the majority, but present. Also noble.

* A BUNCH of black Union soldiers fought too. And I will hazard a guess that these people actually prioritized emancipation much higher than their white counterparts. Self-serving - but still noble intentions.

* A primary political force in the North was the abolitionist movement. These people are travelling in a close-set venn diagram with the money-elite in the North, wielding tremendous power and political influence. Their actions are absolutely noble. These are the people who recognized slavery was wrong way back when it seemed totally normal to most people.

* During the war itself, the Union Army often ended up resembling a mobile refugee camp as black people self-emancipated by running away from their enslavers and followed the Union army north to safety. The Union Army dealt humanely with the situation and provided these people with the food and resources necessary to survive the transition. And they were probably racist pricks about it the whole time. But they DID help. And they certainly didn't return them to enslavement. Call this semi-noble.

So - did people profit off of the war? Of course. That's one of the primary reasons people fight wars.

Reinforcement is something good, punishment is something bad. 

So ""negative reinforcement"" is taking away something they like, such as grounding a child. 

""Positive reinforcement"" is giving them something they like, such as praise or a treat

""Negative punishment"" is taking away an adverse stimulus when they do something good, like a loud noise that gets turned off when they succeed in a task

So basically I won't go into all the details but essentially during the dream I came to the presence of a woman (in a weird context that is however not important) and I felt an immediate warmth and happiness by sitting besides her even though I couldn't exactly tell who she was.

I only later realized that her distorted and painted (for some reason, idk) face was that of my ex-girlfriend.

Remember this for later.

The dream goes on.

Some more weird shit happens and all of a sudden there is the German mathematician Bernard Riemann in the scene (don't ask lol but it's important later) alongside some other people I knew and my mother.

At some point an argument breaks out with my mom for something I can't remember, I go upstairs kinda pissed, leave the scene, I'm suddenly in my bedroom. I hear a woman cry.
I search the room to find where she is, I find her in a corner. It's the same woman from before except she is now smaller and without the skin on her body except her face. 

I ask her why she's crying, she tells me ""I've been cheating on you"". I was confused because I didn't even think that she was my girlfriend then and then she tells me that she had been cheating on me with Riemann.
Huuuhh ok...(?).

My weird ass then asks her ""who were you?"" (I spontaneously used a past, as if I knew that she was actually dead and that was like a ghost or something).

She tells me a name. I couldn't hear the first name. I can hear the last name distinctly: Koch.
I wake up. My first thought is. Dafuq. 
Lemme look up Riemann's wife if he even had one.

Turns out he did: her name: Elise Koch.

My ex-girlfriend's first name: Elise.

I fear dying too early, I'm 27. We are animals of fiction, we forgot that we invented God. We make sense of the world to comfort our minds. We invented spirituality to explain what we couldn't understand, we think of ourselves as being important, while we're insignificant. That is freedom, to know we're on our own with our limits and weaknesses, but we can do what we want and make some sense for our lives. We should look after a society that is more fair for everyone, that is in harmony with nature and where maybe, we could download our minds into AI and create our paradise. I don't advocate for a hyper technological society, I just say it's one option to overcome death. I live as much as I can in nature, in the mountains, the forests, by lakes and rivers. Enjoying the beauty of being alive and share that with others. So that when I die, I'll know that I have shared with others. Stargazing on a summer night by a quiet lake, hiking up a mountain and have a beer with friends watching the scenery, walking on a frozen lake or river and seeing the crisp air and shades of gold and silver light by -20 on a snowy landscape. There are emotions to be felt outside, and Reddit can be on the phone all along. I die inside every time I witness a disturbance in the natural world due to our stupidity. When you walk outside everyday you come to notice all the tiny details that change every day, and that is truly to seize the day. I want to spend my life with the woman I love and die of old age. I want to share the beauty of this world with everyone, to discuss and debate, to help others and to leave something behind, because that's in my human nature. That's insignificant, but that's enough. Don't think in terms of gods, money or politics. Try arts, learn, share, love. And you'll be a happy being even if we don't remember you. We'll be forgotten just like we don't think of everyone else, just like we don't really know all of those who lived before. We just have a simplified idea of the great figures of our history, but that's only a tiny portion of the people who lived in the 300 000 years of our species.

In a really intense and sudden erection there will be like throbs as it swells.  There's also a pretingling down there when I know I'm about to get hard.  If I get it at a time I don't want one, I'm experienced enough to know when I get that tingle to quickly focus on something else if I don't want to get hard. 

But if I'm super anxious or stressed, I can be horny, and get that tingling, but the mussel that needs to relax to allow the blood flow won't relax.  We can't consciously control it.   Stress or anxiety can stop an erection from happening. 

I think it would be good if more men and women understood this part of how erections work, that it's a muscle that needs to relax.  If you're with a dude and he doesn't get hard, it isn't, usually, about you.  It's about their head.  Frequently when I'm with a girl that I really like for the first time, the anxiety and desire to pleasure her is intense enough I have a hard time relaxing.  If you want to help a guy through this, it's kind of like when you want to have sex and you need some foreplay to get wet and relaxed yourself.  

So, slow things down.  And seduce him into getting out of his anxiety and head space that's keeping him from it.

I used to work in K-12 schools as IT field services (so i got a real close eye and ear into many different teaching styles). Over the couple of years I was in that biz, I serviced about 19 schools in completely different areas of the city (Columbus, OH).


And don't get me wrong, it was *definitely* not a common thing to run into the ""total package"" of the trifecta; caring about their students, knowledgeable on the subject, and nice to all their co-workers.

**However**, during many of my days at each of these schools, I really found the common denominator were a combination of the administration and the age/experience of the teacher. I have one school in mind, in particular (it was a K all the way through 12 school too!) where I could legit say that 90% of the educators there probably no-shit saints and knew their shit at the same time.

Fans cool using convective heat transfer. The convective heat transfer coefficient is impacted by the velocity of the fluid (in this case air). Basically, the fast air moves, the more heat transfer take place. The breath example is actually a very bad example because your breath has a high amount of latent energy, and is warmer than the outside air. In the slow breath example with a wide mouth, you are exhaling over your skin which send warm latent air over you skin. You will lose some heat if your skin is warmer than your breath, or gain heat if your skin is colder than your breath. The latent energy of your breath will likely result in a small evaporation cooling effect. In the purse lips example, you are displacing room air over your skin. So in addition to the higher heat transfer coefficient, you are also moving colder air across your skin because its mostly room air and only some of your breath. You can test this yourself by blowing on your hand a foot away from your face, and blowing into you had only 1/4"" away from your mouth. You will notice a distinct change in the heat transfer. The dyson fan cools with room temperature only. Thus all you need to worry about is the air speed. If the air temperature is the same, the fast if flows the higher the heat transfer. So for example if you stood in a room with 40C air, a fan would make you get hotter.

Normally the people who get shot don't practice correct weapon discipline. If you point the gun at a cop when they ask you to drop it, they have to assume you're going to shoot them. Or if you're waving it around trying to show its not a real gun, and if they can't tell all they see is someone who's waving a gun around. It's not their fault people panic and don't listen.

Secondly, on the off chance that it does happen the one thing your post is blatantly ignoring is what a shooting does to cops. Cops have a very high mortality rate, and it's not from outside violence, it's suicide. Cops who end up killing someone who didn't have a real gun, or was panicking are huge reasons why cops kill themselves.

They're humans too, and they make mistakes like everyone else. The reason why a lot of them wait to go to trial is because of the Court of Public Opinion will automatically sentence them guilty. More cops go to jail for accidental shootings than people who accidentally shoot friends or family. At least once every year or so a hunter accidentally shoots another hunter, and there's almost never any kind of legal reprimand.

A cop shoots someone who legitimately seems to be a danger to the public, and that cop is guaranteed to lose their job, prison time is extremely likely. 

Questions like this are hate-bombing, not even paying attention to the subject material you're asking about. I, as a Transwoman, put my faith in them. One or a dozen bad eggs won't deter me, because I know they're still human and aren't perfect. None of us are, so we need to stop persecuting them like somehow they passed some ""Perfection of Humanity and Ethics"" test and try to trust that most of them are doing their best.

Gun control, in your question, wouldn't matter as you're assuming they'd shoot anyways.

There are like educational tutorials online for technique. I’ve also found the nJOY pure wand (a specific sex toy) is seen as the holy grail of toys to make a vagina squirt. I have one and it makes it much easier. 

Another thing with squirting is you have to be relaxed. When my partner is hitting the right spot, and pretty fast, I’ll feel a pressure building up (
 diff than orgasm) and it can feel like you have to pee. Which would normally lead someone to clench up. I usually will pee and empty my bladder just before sex so i can 100% know my urge to pee isn’t real. With the pressure, if I relax into it or even slightly push (rather than clench) I find it helps me squirt. 

I’ve surprised myself masturbating twice by squirting on accident. Both times I was on my bed sitting reclined (so not totally flat but not perfectly upright). Legs spread.

Lots of people have said this, and while I do think it's true, I've only found one and she was just using me for sex :/

&gt;Not for big muscles, but for overall fitness and physical confidence

I would do this, but I dislike physical activity, I'm kinda lazy haha.  But, the one thing I have confidence in is my body.  Not necessarily my looks but my overall shape.  I'm not at a super unhealthy weight anymore, and I do try to get more physical activity, like choosing to mow the lawn with a push mower rather than the lawn tractor.

&gt; and it's not all about being a cocky, arrogant, alpha male.

I know people who are like this and it makes me wonder how women like them, I don't think I'm an asshole but my anxiety always makes me think everything I'm saying is going to offend the person I'm talking to, which is also why I'm afraid of talking to people.

&gt;I have confidence in you. Send me a message in five or ten years and tell me all the good things you did and how your life has turned out.

https://imgur.com/a/fOmvJ7X

&gt;And lastly, I'm going to throw out a challenge to you: Every day, say a word to someone. Doesn't matter who it is or what you say ('hi', 'thank you', 'have a nice day', 'how are you', etc). Like you said- the drive-through at Taco Bell. No matter how nervous you feel. Just a word or two. And yeah, you will judge the fuck out of yourself later, that's the nature of the beast, but do it anyway and congratulate yourself after. Like people who do their few pushups/crunches every day, no matter how they feel about it - you say a word to someone every day. 

Now that you mention it, I already kind of do this.  It's mainly to adults, which I have more confidence with.  Peers on the other hand, not really.  But, for example when I leave my class I'll say ""have a great day"" etc. to the teacher, and I always do this.  I'll try my best to do better but I've got a start on it already (thankfully).

&gt;All the best, sending out a hug - from one nerd to another.

Thank you kind sir, your words mean a lot. 

Have a good one :)",,,1620053897,{},gwsfp2i,False,t3_n3gnmq,False,True,t1_gwsa68j,/r/AskReddit/comments/n3gnmq/whats_a_common_skill_that_you_just_dont_have/gwsfp2i/,1620084211,1,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

My family and I moved into a new house. Our house had what you’d call an out-house or coal-shed attached to it. It’s pretty much just like a garage, but too small to put a car in. We just used it to store our washer dryer and gardening things.

The only way into the out-house was through our kitchen door, which had a lock on it. One day my mum came running into the front room asking me if i heard whistling. I didn’t hear anything. She seemed very spooked, saying she thought she heard someone whistling the tune that her uncle used to whistle (recently deceased at the time).

She said it was coming from the out-house, and asked me to go with her to look. We went to go in, but the key wasn’t there and the door was locked so we couldn’t get in.

Fast forward the next day and the key still hasn’t appeared. I was in the kitchen, and i head BANG, the outhouse door banged so hard. I ran out of the kitchen to tell my dad. He said he didn’t hear anything. Skip to later that day, and my parents are both getting frustrated at not being able to find the key to get to the washer. But they both assume it’ll turn up.

Later that evening the whistling started again, and this time both my parents heard it. I noticed them rush to the door, so i followed. My mum wasn’t scared at all this time, she actually seemed to believe it was her uncle in there. Like he was sending a message. Anyway, my dad starts hitting the door trying to break it down and the whistling of a tune started again for a few seconds and stopped. That was enough to freak them out. So then my dad somehow got the door down (i can’t remember how). We looked in the out-house. There was nobody there at all. But the keys were in there, on the floor in the middle of the room!

Nothing like that has happened since.

Even now it’s a big wtf!! I’ve thought about it over and over and it’s not possible for those keys to have been there and the door to be locked.

Eh, it's tricky to quantify because there's a significant amount of underreporting. I've seen surveys showing that ~16% of GenZ respondents identify as being LGBT+. I think a lot of it is due to sexuality being such a wide spectrum. 

Straight-leaning people who experience attractions to the opposite sex, for instance, are definitely going to be underrepresented. I personally identify as bi (I'm a man), and I've had a ton of male friends and coworkers (mostly GenX and millennials), many happily married to women, who have confided in me their same-sex attractions.

My spouse, our small kids and I were heading home for Christmas. Our flight was out of Seattle but we live several hours away. We got a motel near the airport in Seatac the day before.

The place was pretty seedy but the price was right and the man who checked us in was really nice. He even found some double A batteries for our daughter’s toy which had died on the car ride.

So we get settled in to our room, order some pizza for dinner, and everything is fine. 

Until like midnight. The kids are asleep and we have the light off. We hear Mens voices in the hall and to our shock and surprise OUR DOOR OPENS and the men walk in. 

We of course are like what the eff and my spouse confronts them. They’re totally surprised to find the room inhabited. They back out again and leave and we lock the freaking door. 

Then the phone rings. Our kids are now thoroughly awake. The person on the phone identifies himself as the manager and is all like, “who are you and who checked you in?”

He tells us that they have no record of people being in that room, and asks us how long we are staying. He seems annoyed at us for inhabiting his room? All suspicious like he thinks somehow this family of four sneaked into his seedy ass motel to take a nap. 

He does eventually apologize for the mixup after my spouse gets shirty with him and he hints that they’ll comp us for having strange men walk into our room in the middle of the night. 

The more we fume the less sense it makes. From the conversation with the manager it sounds like it was him walking into our room, not some guests. 

Why was he coming to this room in the middle of the night? Why was he so annoyed with it being occupied? 

Even weirder. The next morning it’s the same dude checking us out. He has no notes about any comping and doesn’t know anything about what happened last night. He doesn’t seem surprised or anything just like “huh. Weird. No notes about it.” 

So his boss didn’t yell at him for screwing up our checkin?

You can have sex for a super long time then basically choose when you want to cum because for most women you’re gonna need to stimulate their clit for them to cum which you have to make a conscious decision to do it usually won’t happen accidentally during sex. 

I do not advocate for faking an orgasm at all either but like if you want to you can do it convincingly. You can’t really do that as a man. Tbh though it’s not always a bad thing to do like if it’s a one night stand and you just aren’t feeling it anymore then who cares. It’s not cool to lie to your actual partner about it though. But ultimately that is still a disservice to the man because he might be going through life thinking he knows what he’s doing when he actually has no clue because people have lied to him.",,,1620053610,{},gwsf23y,False,t3_n3lp2x,False,True,t1_gwrmp35,/r/AskReddit/comments/n3lp2x/what_nsfw_question_have_you_always_wanted_to_ask/gwsf23y/,1620083842,1,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

That may be acceptable, even desirable, for a login session token (roughly equivalent to an in-memory session cookie, but even more volatile), it completely defeats the purpose of having saved searches or customizable default settings.

Also, even if the user sidesteps the volatility of a session token in the URL by bringing the site back up from their URL history, what is the URL history if not ""data storage on \[the user\]'s machine""?  Putting the session token in the URL history and putting the session token in a cookie is *the exact same thing*, except that the cookie has additional support in the browser to make it more easily usable.

I look for things on a resume that show if the applicant is a member of an affiliation/organization (professional or non professional), I look to see if they have invested in their career by getting certifications or additional education, and finally I look at experience like volunteering (can show altruism), travels (can show multiculturalism, acceptance of new ideas), even info about hobbies/family can help set apart neck-and-neck experience. All of these things sort of create a snapshot of an individual's personality, and when it comes to culture fit that is a necessary part of the recruiting process. 

Additional insight - if you really want the job make sure that the key phrases in the job description are also present in your resume. This will help your resume pop up on a search and it'll also help the recruiter quickly determine if you meet the requirements. Always tailor your resume to the job description you're applying for.

  It's a shame because the advertisement sucked from the beginning but it's become a really nicely mature show overtime. There's a lot of animators this past year discussing how their superiors have made bad decisions (rely on creators for advertisement instead of advertising themselves, directly decide to stop making merch after it sells out and then complain it's not making enough money as a show), which is typical but I think the pandemic hit it harder then it would've if it didn't happen. A lot of new shows would gain popularity from at least being small talk but they just don't have that now and it's even more so an issue when being on a specific, small streaming service leads to people discussing it unaware of where to watch it.

As a result, the terms and conditions were full of edge cases and conditions during which you must NOT try to hack a real life target (""you must have an hint pointing to it"", ""automated bruteforce is forbidden, manual bruteforce is permitted and sometimes encouraged"", etc.)  

Minecraft is another example, as the TOS grants to the player some commercial uses, especially in regards to servers

Is it unfair that some people have access to sports coaches who cost tens of thousands of dollars and provide significant performance enhancements over the course of the training? Should we disallow people who have spent money to get better at doing whatever sport they do?

My guess is that your answer to all of those questions is no. Very few people consider those things to be unfair, they're just facts of life - some people are taller. Some people have good genetics. Some people have good coaches.

My mom and step dad would go on trips for work and leave me alone for a week at a time when I was 11/12-18 years old. I had a key, and was told not to miss the bus. I had enough of everything physically, I just needed a lot of attention. I remember feeling like I HAD to have a girlfriend at age 4 so I could feel like a female loved me and wanted me to be around. I am also very agile and a quiet walker, I guess not to bother others.

It was super freaky not only because he had an unnaturally vacant expression on his face, but he was also see through. Like someone had turned his opacity way down.

The part that messed me up the most was that morning we had taken him to the airport. I thought he had died and I was the only one who knew. Of course being thoroughly spooked, I told no one what I saw and waited to be told the news his plane had crashed. However, no one did. A week later Dad came home from his trip, very much alive.

Most of the people I've had sex with did porn re-enacting that seemed to be about the taboo exciting thrill of sex wich gives brain chemicals, and getting to an orgasm. 

Sex is tooooootallly different if you have someone who's interested in creating a lot of sensations all over your body and exploring what you like, and how to create a symphony of pleasure for you.  Also, it all too often seems like society has pushed women into a roll of passive recepticals of dick and cum.  If both people haven't gotten past that social expectation it's really hard to have different sex. 

Most of my conversations with men and women about sex both seem to think guys are okay with being kissed on the lips.  Like being kissed on the dick, and like putting their dick into a hole.  And that's what sex should be for a man.  Well, there's a whole body of sensation.  When I ask guys or girls about a guy having his nipples sucked on or collar bone kissed or stomach kissed, usually I'm met with perplexed looks.  

I'm also a huge hater of what seem to be normal blow jobs where it seems like a mouth is a stand in for a vagina.   I like blow jobs because a mouth and tongue can do totally different things that a pussy can't.  And a pussy is much better at the fucking thing than a mouth is.

We've talked about it since and the wounds have healed, however, our friendship will never be the same. My father told me that my ex just needed an emotional band-aid and my BFAM happened to be the closest one to her so she used him. They didn't date for long.

To answer the question, to me it depends on context. If the wounds of the break up are fresh or still healing, then it's a big no. You don't know how your friend is going to handle it.

People's labor is a more valuable resource than any other
Half the farmers, half the food resources. Half the lumber guys, half the lumber. Half the miners, half the minerals. 

And most production will come to a screeching halt as the remaining workers try to cope with factories and officies designed to be run by twice the people. Once things stop it will be chaos. Looting because half all the ownership is gone and half the police to cover the same amount of streets. Once the chain of supply comes to a halt, people won't have faith in the system. And when people don't have faith in the system they are going to use force to get what they need to survive.

Let's say that there are 3 doors, one with a prize, the other two without a prize. You have to pick a door. You have a 33% chance of getting it right. That means that there is a 66% chance that one of the other doors has a prize.


Now for the tricky part. The host picks one of the other two doors and opens it revealing no prize. You are given the option of keeping your original pick or changing your choice to the other door. On the surface, it would seem like there is now a 50/50 chance. However, in reality, your original door still has the 33% chance of being right, but the third door has a 66% chance. You should always change your choice in that scenario.


Basically what happened is the host knows which door does/doesn't have prizes. If it was behind one of the doors that you didn't pick, he wouldn't open that one. Therefore, the 66% chance gets concentrated into that one other door.

There's the odd female doctor that thinks her experiences are universal but there are a ton of doctors out there that will flat out not believe women when they talk about their experiences. It's absurd honestly, like you figure the people going through the experience would know their bodies but apparantly doctors don't like to believe that.
It's not just women it happens to either. In my experience and from stories I've heard pretty much everywhere I look, the more you the patient show up to an appointment knowing the less likely the doctor is to believe you about what you're going through. This happens *so often* to disabled people.

Obligatory ""not all doctors""- yes, I know there are good doctors out there. Of course there are. But these are my experiences qnd experiences I've heard echoed by countless people.

Learn to enjoy the little things. - Take care of negative memorys that weigh down on your consciousness in the back of your mind, by reevaluating them in a more rational and grown up manner - ""that kid in 5th grade wasn't that evil, just probably had bad parenting, why would I feel bad about how he treated me now?"" -  After you get rid of one of those memorys another one might pop up in your head - that's fine just reevaluate every single one, rationalize, forgive for your own sake, and grow above. 

Next up please learn how to plan make vague plans of what to do with your life, its way easier to drive on a road, than sail on the open stormy sea. Also make sure that you adjust your plans to what you want to do, your plans grow develop and shape with you, so they should be fluid, not set in stone, we don't want to limit ourselves do we? If you have a vague plan make small subtasks and than even smaller tasks to help you work daily towards your goals. That way you feel like you accomplish things - because you actually are. 

Here is some more general advice: 
If you do things for the people around you, next to doing good deeds and beeing a usefull human being, your subconscious will pay you back by giving you a feeling of satisfaction and purpose. 

Don't stress over most things, see them as what they are not what people make them out to be. 

Sometimes people fall in a trap believing everything has to be done in a certain way, but it doesn't, you have the freedom of adjusting what you do in a way that suits you. From the clothing in your drawers and how they are sorted to the way you handle trash. 

People often say take break, why not actually just take a break from everything and do nothing for 15 minutes, relax eyes closed - do it once in a while, it will help to lose the tension. 

Also make sure to strech, backpain and similar issues like neckpain etc can cause a constant slight pain, translating into a ""shadow"" above your head that can darken your day and make you feel less happy. 

Last but not least try to avoid excessive consumption of media of any sort, be it music video or whatever, it can cause overstimulation and numb your emotions making your think you are can't be happy but your actually just like a blade that is overused - if you pause your blade is sharpend again and everything will be fine.",,,1620053372,{},gwseirl,False,t3_n3xdhl,False,False,t3_n3xdhl,/r/AskReddit/comments/n3xdhl/psychologists_of_reddit_how_do_you_manipulate/gwseirl/,1620083521,1,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

I'd say about 50% of dogs are reactive in some fashion.

Behavior modification generally combines managing the environment, medication, and a specific training regimen that involves no punishment besides time outs. It's less about boundaries and more-or-less cognitive behavioral therapy where the thoughts about the scary thing are developed to be less negative by using classical conditioning. See scary thing in the distance? Yay! Fun things! You can even make the scary thing's presence into a cue for fun things which obviously takes the stress off.

Theses one relate to the houses I’ve lived in:

As a child I has horrendous night terrors. Like screaming bloody murder in the middle of the night, not able to calm me down night terrors. At least that’s that the doctor told my mom. I stopped having them when we moved to a different house when I was 5. I don’t remember a lot of my childhood but I remember being terrified all the damn time in that first house. Things would move. You’d walk out of the kitchen for a few minute and return to the cupboard being open. The tv would turn on in the middle of the night, full volume. You would hear pounding footsteps running up the stairs in the middle of the night. I was absolutely terrified of the cellar (it was an old house with a dirt cellar), I wouldn’t even go close to the door. 

My uncle owned this house and let my family live there. Prior to my uncle owning it, an elderly couple had lived there for 40+ years. The man was a real asshole and my dad and uncles apparently liked to pull pranks on him. I found out later in life that he had died in the yard. I legit think he’s still there. My uncle sold the house to my cousin, she tells me there’s nothing in that house but her daughter also developed  night terrors after they moved in. 

The house we moved to was a very old farm house. The original part of the house was over 100 years old. There were... things.... in that house as well but they didn’t feel as malevolent. I woke up often in the middle of the night to a young man sitting in the chair next to my bed or standing in my doorway, dressed in what I can only describe as western banker attire (slacks, white long sleeve undershirt and a fitted vest). I was afraid, but not terrified. I never told anyone in my family about this until my sister described the exact same thing when we were in our teens.

My parents did a lot of renovating in that house. After they tore up all that ugly shag carpeting to reveal original wood floors, I would occasionally hear what sounded like a ball bouncing on the floor. My sister swears that she also seen a little girl and an elderly lady.

You always had the feeling that you weren’t alone or that someone was watching. Our dogs would sit at the bottom of the stairs, looking up and would growl/bark at seemingly nothing.

When I 22 I was staying with my parents for awhile and my sister was home for the weekend to visit. A week prior to this, I woke up in the middle of the night at 2:13 unable to move. I felt like a huge weight was on my chest and I could smell smoke. I’ve read about sleep paralysis and I figured that was most likely what it was, though I had never experienced anything quite like that before. Fast forward a week when my sister is here and I wake up at 2:13 to my dad screaming that the house is on fire. My sister had still been awake, downstairs in the living room reading a book when she smelt the smoke. By the time I got up and downstairs the entire connected garage was in flames. There were only 2 smoke alarms in the house and neither worked that night. If my sister hadn’t been there it could have been so much worse. It still creeps me out to this day to think about my sleep paralysis or whatever the hell it was.

Screaming, yelling, explosions, it was amazing.  I managed to explode a milk and macaroni-filled solo cup against one of the lights, which rained down on a table of kids that were constantly harassing me.

**Look. At. Your. Minimap.**

Look at where your team last saw the enemy jungler. Was it near your lane? Do you need to run? Was it on the opposite side of the map? Do you have time? Furthermore, is it a fast jungler? A Hecarim? A Kayn? Can they surprise gank you? Is your jungler close enough to counter gank? Is your jungler *smart* enough to counter gank? Where's their support? Wheres their top? Do you still see their adc farming bot? Has the enemy team starting moving towards dragon/herald? You need to micomanage all of this info and more.

Further more, you need to win your lane; or atleast go even. Know matchups, but this can only ***really*** come from experience. Do you know how the Yasuo v Ahri matchup works? What about a Malphite v Jayce matchup? Do you know the amount of damage their abilities do? Do you know their cooldowns? Do you know what ability that champion usually levels first? Do know your *own* damage? If you go in right now, can you kill them before they escape/kill you? If fight in their minion wave, how much damage with the enemy minions do to you? Is it so early in the game that fighting in the minion wave is a death sentence? Or is it late enough that it's negatable? Furthermore, do you want to risk poking out the enemy laner, or going for the cannon that's about to die to tower? 

Remember, a few waves of minions is the same amount of gold and a regular kill.

If you're playing bot, do you know your champion? Your support's? The enemy adc's? The enemy support's? What are their cool downs? What are their CC durations if they have any? Is your teammate a competent human being? Does your support roam? If you're the support, does your adc have the balls to go in when you want to, or do they only want to farm all game?

Vision is the name of the game. Place wards in important sections of the map, like dragon pit and pixel bush. If you see where the enemy is, then they cant surprise you. This goes along with the minimap point from before.

Focus on the champion and role that youre good at. Have a pool of 3-5 champions that youre really good at. Better to be the master of those than to be decent at 15 others. This way, you can get to know your lane opponent's champion too. What part of the game is X champion weak? During what point is Z champion strong? Look at their items, see if they've hit their powerspike. If you're playing a skillshot champion, get used to your lane opponent's dodging pattern. Throw out a few skillshots. Do they dodge up? Down? Next time, throw your skill shot slightly up. Did it hit? Are you used to the way they dodge now?
