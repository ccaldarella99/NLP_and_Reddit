I never made that point. Ever. Not once. Yet you still act as if I did. 

&gt;Are you arguing it is a victimless crime?

The question that I have: Are you fucking stupid? Coming up with an argument that hasn't been said and then trying to argue against it, impressive. 

&gt;You've done it to everyone who has replied to you

None of the people that I replied to has shown me a single source that proves that shoplifting hurts the employees. All I've heard so far were 'bUt iT cOuLd HuRt ThEm iF', and 'sOuRcE: TrUsT mE'. 
 
If shoplifting is a problem for employees it should be fairly simple to find studies / articles about the problem, show me them. 

&gt;ap maybe offer the reason why you don't instead

Why would that matter? Would it change anything about you trying to put words in my mouth? Would it change anything about the fact that shoplifting doesn't hurt the employees in general? Would it change anything about the fact that you guys have not provided any evidence so far that can actually be checked? 

I don't steal because I don't think it's morally right to take something that doesn't belong to me. Have fun trying to spin that. ;)

I'll use myself as an example. I'm 29 years old and a woman, so I don't have that many fertile years left. I'm single at the moment, but lets say I wasn't. Lets say I wanted to get my tubes tied, because I don't want kids.

Now lets say I DID want kids and my man did not, instead wanting a vasectomy. What I'd feel like my choices are at that point is either stay with him and get used to the idea of never becoming a mom, or leave him and try to find someone who wants the same thing as I do. The first option is slightly dangerous, because it can really build resentment over a dream lost. In neither example would it be OK to force your partner to do what you want.

And as for the having children for the benefit of society, I could argue that the bigger benefit would be gained from adopting the kids that go parentless and with a lack of love in their lifes instead of having kids of your own considering how many of us there already is on our planet, but I completely understand the difference between those things for the people who feel like they need to have a child biologically.",,,1619549140,{},gw2ynxl,False,t3_mzceyp,False,True,t1_gw2jele,/r/AskReddit/comments/mzceyp/whats_your_opinion_this_quote_cant_feed_them_dont/gw2ynxl/,1619561385,1,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

That's just stating a fact. What I considered combative was doing things like asking a leading question in the title and then being sarcastic or dismissive in all replies. Or siccing a downvote brigade on everyone that disagrees, no matter how gently. Or acting like this singular issue is the dividing line between those who are perfect and those who are disgusting psychopaths.

And it's not even that I'm against being combative in principle. If calling someone names would change their mind and prevent them from killing animals, well, maybe that's a trade worth making. Who am I to say? But anecdotes notwithstanding, in general being combative is considered counterproductive to persuasion. There's even a known technique of being combative *against* the position you want to take, in order to get people to adopt it just to spite you. So not only is it doing something a little evil itself (degrading civil discourse) but it's not even accomplishing the good intended.

I *want* more people to become vegans, or at least to minimize their meat eating. Heck, if most people didn't eat meat it would make it much easier for me to go vegan myself. My goal throughout this thread has been to *improve* the ability of vegans to convince people. I think the way to do that is--without lying or obscuring the facts--to engage people in a civil and empathetic manner (which, by the way, I think you're doing very well, and you've likely persuaded me to be more careful about my diet).",,,1619549097,{},gw2ykeb,False,t3_mzpeuo,False,True,t1_gw2vcf7,/r/AskReddit/comments/mzpeuo/if_you_had_the_option_to_not_contribute_to_the/gw2ykeb/,1619561326,1,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

One of the guys decided to get us to play, everyone agreed because drunk college kids so why not.  Most of the game is going like you would expect, ""kiss them"", ""show is your tits"", ""give us your best fake orgasm"", the usual.  My big sister (fraternity, not actual sister) kept daring one of the girls and I to do whatever came to her devious little mind.  Fairly soon, everyone else piled on so everytime it was our turn, the dare was always with each other and it kept escalating.  By the end of the game, there were more than a few of the people naked, some quite embarrassed about what they had done in public, the girl was given a dare to give me a lap dance, she did, and just stayed sitting on my lap afterwards.  The game wound down and we left together since well, why not.  We ended up fucking on the couch in my room, dated for a while and split up.  

The worst thing for me that night was the one dare that didn't involve her.  I was dared to run naked and waving our flag around the area of campus known as The Valley of the Dolls since it was just 3 women's dorms.  It wouldn't have been bad but a) it was December so it was cold and Mr. Happy decided to go all scared turtle and b) they made sure that I had everyone's attention by blaring an air horn and shining a spotlight on me as I ran.  I guess if a girl decided to stay with me after seeing by dick become an innie because of the cold, it couldn't have been all bad.

Not even going into life after death, just looking at this life for now. As missionaries we go out to share that and help people see things from a different perspective.
