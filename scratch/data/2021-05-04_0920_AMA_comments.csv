Question | Answer | Link
---------|----------|----------|
ive always been wanting to ask an intersex person this!! do you consider yourself under the transgender umbrella? ive heard very mixed things about the topic  also! were you forced to have any “corrective” surgeries as a child?|No surgeries as a child, my parents were always very supportive and just wanted what was best and safest for me.  I consider myself a cisgender male. Yes I have female sexual organs that obviously work where as my male organs don’t but I have always seen myself as a guy, both physically and mentally.  That being said, I was very insecure for a long time. I always liked girls but never dated because of my condition, I didn’t want anyone to find out. My now husband was one of my best friends throughout high school. He was one of the few I ended up telling and easily the most accepting and understanding person to know. He made it a little bit easier to open up about my condition. We started dating my senior year of high school (he’s a year older and was a freshmen in college by that time). It was his first time being with a guy as well but I’d say it turned out pretty okay!  Nowadays, I could honestly care less what anyone thinks. I still consider myself male but since marrying my husband, I will often find myself wearing dresses, skirts, yoga pants, etc. I’ve sort of embraced being the ‘wife’ in the relationship. I have no plans to ever fully transition. I’m truly happy right where I am.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n46t1h/im_a_23_year_old_intersex_male_i_was_born_with/gwttug9/)
Wait, so you have functioning ovarian and testicular tissues?|I have a penis, testicles, and a vaginal opening. I cannot produce sperm.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n46t1h/im_a_23_year_old_intersex_male_i_was_born_with/gwtt5h2/)
How tall are both you and your husband?|I’m 5’11 and my husband is 6’4.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n46t1h/im_a_23_year_old_intersex_male_i_was_born_with/gwu2yhe/)
So was your husband into dudes or women before you? Is your voice like a man or a woman's? Boobs? Can you get a boner and how big is your weiner? Does it get erect when you're getting penetrated vaginally? What is your preferred method of sexual pleasure from your husband? Do your kids call you mom or dad?|Like myself, my husband was exclusively into girls before we became a couple. He actually had a girlfriend at the time when we realized we had feelings for each other. I’ve never take estrogen or had any work done so my voice is naturally deeper. However, I often speak in a higher tone to befit my more feminine appearance and lifestyle. There are times where the natural voice comes out though and my husband does a double take.  I never had sizable breasts but during my first pregnancy, they started to grow and I have what I would call small boobs now. The doctor has told me that they will likely grow larger with each pregnancy so we shall see. My penis does get erect and as for the size - I guess it’s fairly average?! Still a lot smaller than my husbands though! He often jokingly refers to me as mommy around our daughter. Honestly though, I could care less what our children call me. Being a loving and caring parent, whether that be as mom or dad, is way more important to me.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n46t1h/im_a_23_year_old_intersex_male_i_was_born_with/gwunsch/)
Do you wear male or female underwear?  What are some challenges that have resulted from being intersex?  How have both your and other children reacted?|1) Both. I always dressed masculine up until my marriage. Now, I cross dress and find myself wearing feminine clothing more often than not.  2) Growing up was super hard for me. I never pursued a girlfriend because I knew they would eventually find out. I feared every single day that someone at school would somehow learn of my condition and spread the news.  3) Not exactly sure what you are referring to but if you mean my pregnancy, the response from our family and friends was amazing. Nothing but support and encouragement, no judgmental whatsoever. My family has always had my back 100%. My husband comes from a more traditional background but his parents have come around and are beyond ecstatic to be grandparents!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n46t1h/im_a_23_year_old_intersex_male_i_was_born_with/gwu75wn/)
How do you find navigating the world as a pregnant cisgender (intersex) male (having read your other comments)? Is your healthcare good - do the doctors care for you well? Do people do double-takes?  I hope you and your baby are healthy and happy! Good luck with everything!|My husband has a great job with top notch benefits so I’m beyond grateful in that aspect. I have a main doctor (who is awesome) and also a specialist who has experience working with people who have similar conditions to mine.  Baby girl is doing great. Due date is in September but I have a feeling she will be early. Both pregnancies have been surprisingly smooth, I’ve been able to enjoy every moment of this beautiful experience.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n46t1h/im_a_23_year_old_intersex_male_i_was_born_with/gwu6dnf/)
Are you pregnant?|Yep! 5 months along.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n46t1h/im_a_23_year_old_intersex_male_i_was_born_with/gwtw9fo/)
Do you show being pregnant as much as a woman? How do people on public react?|I would say I show just as much, if not more, than the average woman. I mainly dress in feminine clothing and will sometimes wear light makeup so many don’t ever blink an eye. There have been some instances where I’ve gotten obvious looks but I’ve never had anybody say something directly. If they did, I would be happy to tell them my story and hopefully educate them on being intersex.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n46t1h/im_a_23_year_old_intersex_male_i_was_born_with/gwug1uq/)
Do the kids look more like your husband or yourself? Just curious how the genetics play into all of this.|My husband has blue eyes and blonde hair and I have dark brown hair and hazel eyes. Our oldest daughter got my husbands hair/eye color but I think she got some of my facial features.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n46t1h/im_a_23_year_old_intersex_male_i_was_born_with/gwu3ywi/)
Wow thanks for doing this! I hope my questions aren’t offensive! Do you consider yourself homosexual/gay? Did you get pregnant the typical way? Any complications with pregnancy? What sex were you assigned at birth? Congrats on your new little one on the way! Oh and one more: do you friends know you’re intersex (I assume they would need to know to understand that you’re pregnant) or do most people assume you’re male?|I am listed as male on my birth certificate. My husband is the first and only male I’ve ever been attracted to so it’s sort of tough describing my sexuality. We conceived 100% naturally. Both my first and current pregnancies have been incredibly smooth, very few troubles. Hoping that’s the case for the future ones!  After years of keeping everything so secret, I’m proud to say I’ve reached the point in my life where I can proudly tell everyone my story.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n46t1h/im_a_23_year_old_intersex_male_i_was_born_with/gwuczj5/)
WhT bathroom do you go to in a public dpace|Men’s. Gotta take advantage of those shorter lines and urinals!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n46t1h/im_a_23_year_old_intersex_male_i_was_born_with/gwu48f9/)
what specific masculine and feminine features do you have?|I have a penis, testicles, and a vaginal opening.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n46t1h/im_a_23_year_old_intersex_male_i_was_born_with/gwtsr9x/)
1. Congratulations!! I fucking love being a dad and I wish I could have more of these little bastards, but ya know, money and time is sparse. Do you plan on having more children?  2. Will delivery be vaginal or c-section?|Thanks! We do plan on having more, no idea as to how many but we both want a rather large family. Our first daughter was born naturally and that is the plan for the next one.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n46t1h/im_a_23_year_old_intersex_male_i_was_born_with/gwuluxz/)
How fascinating, that’s just amazing. You’ve answered all the obvious questions I would ask but I’ll still give something - what’s the username stand for? Also, any chance you write a book on of these days? If this post is any indication, it would be a bestseller in no time!|Writing a book would be fun, maybe one day!  As for the username, it’s just my first/middle/last name initials and my birth year.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n46t1h/im_a_23_year_old_intersex_male_i_was_born_with/gwurygd/)

And to have tens of millions just sitting in bank accounts. Wtf. When all that money could be put to better use helping people or society. 

Taxes should be so much higher on richer people.

But yeah debate once with some guy. He said if the government takes most of the spare money out of those bank accounts then it's stealing. Even let's say if it was a new law right, it would be stealing. Because it is. But i say i don't care... good. Steal it. They don't need or deserve it.

So much income inequality in the world man. The top footballers being paid millions. Singers and celebrities being paid millions. While we have homeless people in every country. Homeless and poor people. What the hell kind of society are we. A capitalist one. A greedy one. A selfish one. 

That's what we are. I'm guilty of it too. I'm guilty of not doing enough. To help solve the issues in society. To help prevent income inequality. To not do enough for society. But when i see the state of humanity and the state of the world in this age, it just makes me not care. 

I used to be so optimistic. And i still am about our possible future. It is so bright. Mostly because of technology solving our problems. But still. But you know, recent years, i look at the world. I see the climate crisis worsening. I see constant inequality and crime all over the world continuing. I see China committing a form a genocide and nobody can do anything.

you're differing opinion is not conducive to the facts. almost every single place in which communist regimes were in place reached high standards of life. despite what you may think, multiple famines under the USSR and China are provably not the fault of communism. the death numbers are very exaggerated to say the least. the African country of Burkina Faso was very, very economically powerful under the leadership of the ML Thomas Sankara. after his assassination the quality of life immediately plummeted. Cuba had a higher literacy rate than the U.S.

there are so many successes that communist nations have had, it'd take me forever to list them all. capitalism is an inherently contradictory philosophy. it's boom and bust cycles are unsustainable and it's resources usage is even more unsustainable. it can't go on forever.

I think what people perceive as quality is how well something meets the standards of what the observer believes that thing ought to be like. As in, the observer must have an idea of how something SHOULD be, then with that in mind, judging the actual thing, can gauge the quality of that thing. 

Without any idea of how something ought to be, it would be impossible to gauge quality. Say you see a movie in a language you don’t understand. How could you judge the quality of the dialogue of that movie? Impossible. 

Example. You order a pizza. It appears the chef put together all of the ingredients of a normal pizza in an order that manifested a congealed mass rather than the cheesy disc expected. You would say “this is not a quality pizza”. Less extreme, the chef leaves the pizza in for too long and burns it. No longer a quality pizza. 

Inferences can be made based on some partial prior knowledge, but never a full assessment. If I, who is not an architect, saw a building made of heavy steal and rivets, cut stone and cement, I could infer this may be a quality constructed building based on the amount and type of material used. But I could never make a full educated assessment of the buildings quality given I do not know anything of it structurally.

Roma or Gypsy are from northern India/Sri Lanka. They are an ethnic minority throughout Europe and North America that unfortunately have a very traumatized past as nomads. The myth/folklore from the oral history says there was a war in Northern india and a big loss in a kingdom, as part of the loss the royalty had to give land and people over. 

They were given thousands of artists, royal entertainers, and musicians. Those people spread throughout the land but had very little work do the kept moving west. 

Today to be called a gypsy or a Turk is an insult (not me, but culturally) if that says anything about the state of affairs.

This in spirit i completely disagree with! The rational mind can explain everything given enough time. Everything will one day be explained by the rational mind.

The debate over how healthy it is. The ignorance of the older generation in relation to how healthy bacon is. They don't really care. Maybe it's too late for them. 

How healthy is bacon. What are the ways bacon can be cooked. What is the healthiest way to cook bacon. Google!

But importantly, to make sure to still retain the good bacon taste even in the journey to healthy. But on the otherhand... fuck it. We're lazy. Aren't we. We just eat bacon and move on.

I'll tell you. It was the egg. Evolution done shit to grow the egg to grow into the creature and then that lay another egg similar to the original. Wait... what if evolution of the molecules of life then made the creature to then make the first egg. But did the first molecules of life make the egg first. Fuck i don't know.

What was interesting was we were very insular and kept to ourselves. We found a romanian community in the city where we were and grew up amongst other romanian kids. So because of that I am still fluent. 

I did not have any conflict until my teens (no surprise) when I decided to cut my hair short and culturally that was like feminine suicide. It was a sign of autonomy over my body though. I left home when i was 17 after i got my passport and freelanced living in china, france, germany, and back in Romania. 

My parents were supportive of my entrepreneurial pursuits but would have preferred if I had a male accompaniment on my travels for safety (because women dont have common sense...) and the idea that i always should take care of my beauty because i could marry a man as a main provider was brought up. So those would be the main conflicts years ago. 

But they have acculturated and adjusted where that is not an issue and they see that i can take really good care of myself.

2. Very bluntly, cold, calculating and honest in my experience. Death is part of the job, so neither you nor your organisation is under any illusion in that regard. So that's always taken into consideration when planning a mission, for instance, how many people do we expect to lose. Money was usually secondary and the success on the mission was considered above else. So both money and the lives of the individual were second hands.   
But on the other hand, you are considering a valuable asset, and a dead asset is not a very effective one.    
I think the best way to but it is like this: if you view it from the perspective of the organisation as a separate entity separate from the people working then in my case you were just considered an asset or a tool to complete a job in the grand scheme of things.  
But on the other hand said the organisation is built up of people, and in my case, they really cared.   
So I guess my best answer to your question is that it's rather complicated and my experience might not be reflecting the bigger picture.  
Most people I've talked to from different organisations has said it was all about the money, but I can only speak from my own experiences.  

3. That tend to wary, from what I've heard of people working at the bigger firms/organisations it often seems that way, I personally don't have a background in standard military so it's kind of hard for me to tell.  
But I can say that we didn't have the same ranks, but if you go to Wikipedia and look at ""Military\_organization"" and the 4 at the bottom of ""Army hierarchy"" you wouldn't be too far off.  

4. In my case, it basically could be summed up with: ""Don't break international laws, don't cause any unnecessary suffering.""   
I know I'm kind of repeating my self but I'm not sure how it was other places.  
Then it comes to immoral orders I'm not quite sure how to answer.  
On one hand, I feel like most orders given in war could be considered immoral in one way or the other.  
On the other, there are defiantly grads to that, and I know from the people I've talked to that they definitely had to follow some.  
And I happen to be lucky enough to work for an organisation with rather reasonable people.

HTP axis regulates a not-insigificant part of the endocrinologic feedbacks loops, one of the main systems that it regulates is corticosteroids production like cortisol (from the adrenal glands) and TSH, which controls the thyreoid production levels of T3 and T4.  
excessive cortisol production can lead to MANY problems, from immunossupression to metabolic problems.  
When you assume a disfunction in the HTP axis, you can infeer that your patient could have, aside from adrenal and thyreoid problems, a bad regulation for reproductive hormones, as HTP axis regulates FSH for example.  
So it is not far fecthed at all to assume that a mother with metabolic, or adrenal, or reproductive hormones out of regulation will have a very problematic gestation AND labor.  
As for the specific intellect problems, the nervous system has to mature a lot inside the womb yet, it ""grows"" as it is stimulated properly by itself and other hormones and cells, so a child can really have its neurodevelopment compromised if the mother is not being a ""balanced environment"". If it doesnt develop well, there is just as much that neuroplasticity can do on that department, then you might see some deficits as the child grows...  
i had to go a lot from memory here, its been a while i dont study embryology, but i hope it was helpful, the main thing is to remember that FSH and other hormones are controled by the HTP axis, if it goes haywire, the entire metabolism and body functions go downhill on their own feedback loops.",,,1620085097,{},gwufe8n,True,t3_n43bjf,False,True,t1_gwtsuz6,/r/AMA/comments/n43bjf/i_am_the_psychologist_that_does_amas_every_other/gwufe8n/,1620122631,1,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],

A simplified version of modern economic politics can be viewed as a spectrum. On one side is libertarianism and the other communism. Libertarianism is 100% free market for everything. Absolutely no public works or any government intervention whatsoever. No tarrifs, no taxes, no safety regulation, no bailouts, no economic stimulus, no subsides, and no boarders for any economic activity. 100% decentralized. On there other side is communism, which comes in 2 forms, on paper and in practice. On paper is that there are no classes and everything is evenly distributed. It's supposed to be one giant communal system. But in practice, it's virtually impossible to do without a centralized state. Obviously that power over resources mixed with centralization brings a class system through power, and corruption through so much power. This is where many western communist supporters think communism went wrong, but they tend to ignore the social, human, logistic, and economic realities that will emerge from any community outside of a small commune. But due to this communism in reality, it brings totalitarianism and therefore total state control and all the atrocities that will come with unchecked power, but at the same time it's argued by believers of communism that pure libertarianism in reality will bring an oligarchy ran government which will result in the same thing. But in all fairness, most libertarians do tend to be against monopolies to avoid this, but a democratic free market state has yet to turn into this, but we'll see, or maybe not, who knows. In the middle of these two political economic theories is socialism. Socialism believes is a free market, but not for things that are considered fundamental human rights.  Healthcare, housing, food, safety, jobs, etc. But there's no single socialist idea, socialism is essentially the middle ground and therefore the grey area. If one likes medicare and medicaid and farm subsidies, but don't like full free healthcare, it's socialist. If one likes having options of local products but wants economic barriers from countries like Mexico and China so that their town/city/country can better compete, that's socialist. If one likes the ability to work as much as they like but also likes a gauranteed minimum wage, weekends, and maternity leave that's socialism. If one likes any publicly funded support, including infrastructure, police, fire stations, basic education for everyone, and safety regulations for food, medicine, and water, it's socialism. Socialism is public control of some stuff, but not everything. Albeit, public control with large populations means state control, which hopefully has a fair democratic system to keep those in power in check, but that's a whole different story.",,,1620084027,{},gwud5kl,False,t3_n3vvs4,False,True,t1_gwu8a2r,/r/AMA/comments/n3vvs4/i_am_a_romanian_communist_refugee_that_moved_to/gwud5kl/,1620121445,2,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],

OP has provided no real depth or story in any of their (very minimal) replies. Being sucked in to an extremist group is far more complex than this.  
  
Also, OP downplaying the danger of Neo Nazis is not cool, and very ignorant. Maybe the group OP was involved in *seemed* pretty ‘harmless’ and just angry voices on the internet, but there are plenty of horrendous acts going on in the world carried out by those holding Neo Nazi beliefs that are anything but harmless. Neo Nazis are a seriously dangerous and extremist terrorist group.  Suggesting anything less is highly offensive and disrespectful to all the victims and suffering they cause, and have caused throughout history. 

Either OP is lying about having been a Neo Nazi, or they’re still not fully comprehending things or aren’t actually willing to talk about it.

It's different than other genres in that it goes farther, you can get away with more. There's a lot of slow buildup in horror, until hits you with a noticable slam. Like mystery, you hint things slowly, but instead of the mystery being solved, you get a scare. You get to see characters in a constant state of fear, how they react to pressure. It's fun to write, because I get to twist normal things and make them scary. You get to be creative with it, people are more accepting of crazy ideas.

For example the workers in the supermarkets keeping the lines stocked, the ones on the offshore plattform (at least until no more oil is required in the economy) or the cleaners that tidy up a crime scene?

Wouldn't a fair wage resolve the money problem you describe too?

Why learn high level math when you can learn about how to file taxes, or how a cell works when you can learn live saving basic first aid? I have a actually useful course for 7th to college classes, kindergarten - 6th grade is when you learn basic stuff, math (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), how to read and different word stuff (vowels, pronouns, verbs, etc.), and social manners (how to treat ands respect others, how to ask questions without sounds rude, etc.). 7th and 8th would be discovery years, where they take small class sessions and find out what they really want to learn about (these classes are flexible, so they can change at the students discretion to another class if they so choose) 9th - 12th (high school) would expand on those classes they chose that they enjoy, then 13th - 16th (college) would expand more on those classes, and help students get hands on with what they want to do for a job after college, colleges would also help get job offers to students that have the potential for them after college. That would be an ideal system, but everyone has a different image for school.

My ex struggled with mental health issues (depression and an eating disorder) for almost a year until this winter. I was always there for her to support her, push her to get help, and so on. When our spring semesters started (we’re both in college), she went to school and I went to FL with my parents where I know nobody. She’s in a sorority and I had nobody. 

The rest of this all happened in the last 2 weeks before she ended things...

She really found her footing at school and had great friends and was going out having fun. I was starting to lose it, struggling with drugs, self worth, and depression. We went very suddenly from talking all day every day to barely an hour or two (because she was so busy). And that bothered me, so I told her in a really respectful way that I felt like I needed more, maybe we do zoom dates one night a week or whatever. And she told me I needed to respect her time with her friends.

Then the trust problems started. Mostly stemming from my own insecurities (I think), I started overthinking her not answering me or going out with frats etc. and it took a toll on our communication. We really had a few nights where I would express how I felt and she’d kinda flip it on me that I was needy and pressuring her. I didn’t think that was really true because we’d talk for an hour a day and she’d go out every single night and me asking for 1 date night a week was needy? 

Anyways, she suggested we go on a break, I agreed, and an hour later she called me back freaking out that she can’t lose me. So we ended that and went on as normal. Then about a week later I said something that she interpreted as me not trusting her (it honestly wasn’t that, but as soon as she got defensive I started to not trust her again). And we had a fight. I said we should go on a break, and we didn’t talk for 6 days before she called me and ended things.

She said she felt like she was slipping back into her mental health problems because of all the stress and pressure of our relationship and just ended it. I suggested a long break until summer (when we could see each other) and she said no, and left me.",,,1620074838,{},gwtt1ia,True,t3_n3gmnj,False,True,t1_gwszbi7,/r/AMA/comments/n3gmnj/im_privileged_grew_up_rich_was_gifted_in_school/gwtt1ia/,1620111039,2,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],

1. though i am not planning on getting a phalloplasty or metoidioplasty myself, (you are probably thinking of a phalloplasty, which is the surgery that is meant to aesthetically look the most like an AMAB ((assigned male at birth)) penis) i know a few things about phalloplasty because my boyfriend is planning on getting one! for one, to answer your question frankly, no, you dont have much say in what your penis will look like. that kind of depends on your own body and where the skin graft will come from. its not really possible to to make a phalloplasty penis look uncut, so thats not an option at the moment with current technology. there are three options for skin graft locations, your arm, your leg, and well, your butt. most people choose their arm, because it has more nerves in it and will create better sensations. an important thing to note is that phalloplasty erections do not make the penis bigger, so the penis is always the same length and size. so, most who get a phalloplasty will decide on 6 inches as per surgeon recommendation. so, aesthetically, you can only suggest things to the surgeon. but there are options you do have! like whether or not you want the implant that makes erections possible, or if you want the urethra lengthening and hookup, or if you want to remove the vagina or bury the clitoris in the phallus (which makes penetrative sex more pleasurable) or not. theres a lot of interesting nuances to bottom surgery!!

2. i agree, dicks are weird and cool lol

3. not really, some of the symptoms overlap, like your periods stopping, maybe vaginal dryness, lower estrogen. but you dont really have the negative parts like hot flashes or mood swings and stuff. testosterone actually kinda balances your mood more, too. (though when i get angry i feel more violent than i used to) also, testosterone weighs more into masculinization rather than only slowing estrogen production. :))

4. i like this question!! so basically, unsure if you know or not, but in lgbt culture theres actual titles for this stuff you may or may not have heard of! theres tops, who are the ones who penetrate their partner, the “givers” if you will, and the bottoms, who are penetrated, or the “receivers”. theres also dominant and submissive roles that play more into bdsm culture but i wont get into that, just know that they mean different things than top and bottom lol. anyway, a lot of trans men do have a problem with bottoming for that reason - they dont want to feel or be seen as someone feminine. others dont like to bottom because they simply arent into it. i, however, bottom pretty exclusively, and am not into topping because im just not into it. (some people like to do both) it can be embarrassing at times, but its just what i like in the bedroom :)) it doesnt really make me feel like a woman, but it used to, and it took time to really understand that i myself am just as much a man as any other, even when i bottom during sex. :D",,,1620074585,{},gwtsgxf,True,t3_n3zgus,False,True,t1_gwtg1ap,/r/AMA/comments/n3zgus/i_am_a_gay_19_year_old_pre_op_transgender_man/gwtsgxf/,1620110747,1,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],

Question | Answer | Link
---------|----------|----------|
What do you think  of the current political climate in the United States?|Culturally and politically terrifying. Also, the way that marxism is talked about in colleges (not so much primary/elementary school) is terrifying. The recent past adminidtration and following of leadership feels like repeating history.  I do not see dialogue or real debate, only speaking in buzzwords and empty sound bites.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3vvs4/i_am_a_romanian_communist_refugee_that_moved_to/gws3mva/)
What were some of the most difficult parts of American culture to get used to?|The language and various cultural traditions. Picked up some basic spanish from my neighborhood in chicago - it was all fellow immigrants from puerto rico, mexico, and haiti. Language I learned through PBS TV watching Arthur and Zoom.  Culturally Americans did not understand family roots versus the individual (it is still something I am working through). The indebtedness to family and roles is ingrained. When I would hear the way kids talked to their parents I was stunned at the disrespect.  Also finances in America - everything on a credit card or a lot of invisible money. I grew up very frugal (we had to) and it was a treat to get a one slice pizza or a gyro from the greasy spoon down the road.  We were insulated until maybe until i was 13/14 with just other immigrants or finding the romanian community and when it came to middle school/high school it felt very different. I remember when a kid said I had an accent and I could not pinpoint what that meant.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3vvs4/i_am_a_romanian_communist_refugee_that_moved_to/gws81jz/)
What are your opinions on religion?|Such a big question! In relation to society? The individual? Me personally?|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3vvs4/i_am_a_romanian_communist_refugee_that_moved_to/gwt8xpk/)
You said you were in Germany first why move from that to America?|Since we were not citizens of Germany and the Eastern bloc was really volatile they limited how many people could stay. We didn't make the cut. Repeating hidtory of migrants from central and south america crossing the border into the US.  In a way Eastern europeans were the undesireables|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3vvs4/i_am_a_romanian_communist_refugee_that_moved_to/gwsfdxg/)
Does the Romanian chick from the movie dodgeball look anything like Romanian women?|Lol I had to google it - no way! If you ever go to the Transylvanian villages you will find the old grandmas with their headscarves, being plump and out of a fairytale book.  Most Romanian women (since there were many rulerships and wars) have hungarian, saxon, middle eastern, jewish, and roman ancestry.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3vvs4/i_am_a_romanian_communist_refugee_that_moved_to/gwsaiut/)
I've been to Romania twice, including an epic motorcycle ride. I have about a dozen Romanians as friends on Facebook.  One of them has not been to RO since he was a little child and was jealous of my trips.  How many times have you visited?|So good to hear! Did you ride the transfagarasan? I have been back now 3 times! Took my mom back to visit after 25 years most recently.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3vvs4/i_am_a_romanian_communist_refugee_that_moved_to/gwtm989/)
Hristos a înviat! Bună, nu știu cât de fluent iești în limba română deci osâ pun întrebarea în engleză.  My parents and I moved from Romania to Canada 12 years after the revolution. A question from a Romanian immigrant to another... Do you believe Romania will ever get rid of its corruption in the government and institutions as time passes on? I believe corruption is so engrained in the nation because of the Communist regime that was before. However my theory is that things will turn around with new more modern politicians such as Dacian Ciolos and Dan Barna, and the younger generation.|Hristos a inviat si pasti fericit!  Always nice to meet kindred spirits. I would agree unfortunately. I think unless the diaspora goes back to change things there is too much collective trauma that is not addressed. I am in school for psychology and one of my goals is to go back and heal collectively and preserve the ethnographic culture and folklore.  Trebe sa citesc de ciolos si barna ca nu stiu enough.  True immigrant RomEnglish style aicia!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3vvs4/i_am_a_romanian_communist_refugee_that_moved_to/gwtodhw/)
Do you get offended when people unironically support communism? What about socialism?|Not so much offended but hurt. I mentioned in another response the brushing over the awful things that happened under communism - the genocides, the land and property destroyed and stolen, the culture erased..  I am hurt that the history is not more talked about in the West. That is what history ( I think ) is taught, to learn from past mistakes.  I was working retail when a guy came in wearing lots of communist paraphernalia and began going into why the communist system is so great.  Dude I am just selling soaps and perfumes - the way he spoke to me as some ignorant worker I gently responded with I survived communism.  His response (kills me) ""that was not real communism.""  It is ignorance by choice.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3vvs4/i_am_a_romanian_communist_refugee_that_moved_to/gwsg65o/)
How do you feel about the fact that most eastern Europeans who've lived through both systems prefer socialism?|I think capitalism has its faults and there needs to be security nets for disadvantaged in society. Also HEALTHCARE.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3vvs4/i_am_a_romanian_communist_refugee_that_moved_to/gwsreo0/)
wait how old are you then? didnt that happen 76 years ago?|Happened in '89|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3vvs4/i_am_a_romanian_communist_refugee_that_moved_to/gwtlhzw/)
Can you speak romanian?|Da!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3vvs4/i_am_a_romanian_communist_refugee_that_moved_to/gwto2xt/)
During a single 24 hour day period how many people do you attempt to scam?|I think you are mixing Roma with Romanian. Stereotypically and culturally we get conflated.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3vvs4/i_am_a_romanian_communist_refugee_that_moved_to/gwtlbv1/)

In terms of ease of trade, yes it is a collection of ~~28~~27 countries in one go. Most goods imported into one country can be traded in any other countries without having to deal with customs. That's the whole idea behind the EU/single market.

&gt;And anyways a single army made of any given 28 countries should have enough firepower to defend themselves rather than leech on someone from another part of the world. 

The EU is home to some of the most advanced armies/navies in the world. Collectively and in absolute terms the EU is third in the world in terms of military spending, after the US (obviously) and China. Germany and France (as well as the UK, as a NATO member) individually spend almost as much as Russia anyway. This isn't the whole story, but it gives you an idea.

&gt;Can’t they just spend 2% of their gdp and improve their military as a collective.

I think they should, but this isn't a discussion about black and white. It isn't Europe is 100% capable of defending itself vs Europe is completely defenseless. The truth is somewhere in the middle. Ultimately American strategic objectives In Europe align with European interests, so it's not all that surprising that European powers feel confident not to arm themselves to teeth when there's absolutely no urgent reason to do so.
 
&gt;Also last I checked EU has population of 440 million and they’re shitting their pants on russia which has 1/3rd of the population. 

Russia is an agitator, a serious threat on the Eastern border to non-EU nations. But Russia isn't under the impression it could mount any kind of serious threat to the integrity of NATO or the EU. Its economy isn't nearly healthy enough to support that.

&gt;Only Ireland in Europe has US as their biggest trading partner. Most of them have China so going by that logic maybe China should be the one setting up military bases there. 

This is just plain nonsense man. Most European countries are each other's biggest trading partners which is a display of a functioning internal market and outside of the EU it's a mix of UK, US, China and a few other places. Yes China is powerful, but that says more about China than the EU.

When growing up and even now, the biggest advantage is that our hotel offers a game room with things like ping pong, air hockey, foosball, and at one time a pool table. Although that had gotten destroyed. - Also discounted rates made drinking at parties with my friends very easy and safe, so I usually hosted parties lol. Although, since I live in such a rich area my friends did have some nice houses, I even dated a girl who's mom and step dad live in a mansion. That place was sick as hell. (Side note her birth dad also worked for Pixar, has no relevance here, but I think it's cool as hell. She was a credit baby on Monster's inc.)

Disadvantage would probably be lack of privacy. My mom's apartment (My former home) had a door just to the side of the front door which was our front door. We had many people walk into our house thinking it was the front entrance, even though it says private, and the front entrance is two huge wooden doors with decorative glass. The worst one was that we'd had a gentleman come into our apartment late at night while everyone was sleeping, and go to bed in our guest room. (Her apartment has three bedrooms, guest room was across from mine.)  I remember early in that morning he'd opened my door and said ""Hey"" to me. I then heard him open my dad's door and my dad threatened to kick his ass, and he ran away and called a cab. To this day  I don't know if he was a guest here or not. I was too young to have worked here so it went over my head. 

My room's  window was also the closest to our outdoor pool. So when people went out there and were loud as hell, they would sometimes keep me awake. We close our pool at 10:00pm so I tended to be the biggest proprietor of ""Someone snuck into the pool"" complaints. My window being there though meant people could peer straight into my window when I was a kid, so I never left it open. 

Obviously most of my friends don't have random people sleeping in their house, and the likes. It made some night pretty annoying to have to sleep.

so, at first i didnt know that there was a word for what i felt. i always saw myself differently, i didnt really feel “female” (or “male” for that matter) and the concept of gender was something i mostly ignored. i was probably 11 or maybe even 10 when i was first exposed to the concept of gender euphoria. (if you dont know what that is, its basically the psychological satisfaction or joy when your gender identity is affirmed by something) basically, i had someone “misinterpret” my gender and call me handsome. i was floored, it felt so right, so i didn’t correct them. it was then that i started looking into the concept more online, finding videos of people talking about transgender concepts and hormone treatment. when i was 12 i started presenting myself as male online, and i had never felt so comfortable and happy being perceived that way. basically i kept it a secret for a while, before i told a couple of my friends. then the secret got too much to bear, because i felt like i was living a double life, and one of them just made me sad to live in, so i came out to my immediate family. it was tough, it was really hard to do as a 12 year old kid, and my parents didnt really understand. i think they were expecting me to come out as lesbian so it really threw them for a loop lol. from then on it was a little bit easier, but i still had to keep it a secret until i got out of middle school. the reasoning for that was because i went to a catholic school, and my parents wanted to keep me safe. it was a suffocating and dangerous two years for me, but i made it!!
