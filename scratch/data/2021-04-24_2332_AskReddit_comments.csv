It was 3 years ago. I was 29 at the time so it was a tough decision to choose between something at least seemingly “secure” vs what is essentially an unknown path.

I spent a lot of my free time during my last 2 years of school researching alternative career paths within healthcare before even considering something outside and analyzing what I like and disliked about my current situation. 

Only you know what you want. So being able to put those preferences into concrete thoughts as opposed to just feeling the dislike for the current situation helped me find the right path.

Some time later, when I had my anxiety more under control, she asked me if it helped my pain and I told her that my pain was exactly the same, maybe a little worse.

I explained that I was still getting a lot of medical tests done and she decided I was in denial about how anxious I actually was.

I fpubd out that my gallbladder is non functioning and rather inflamed. It took a long time to find it because I got normal ultrasounds and typically a low functioning gallbladder has gallstones.

A listener asks G'Kar, ""What is truth, and what is God""

G'Kar replies:
""If I take a lamp, and shine it towards the wall, a bright spot will appear on the wall. The lamp is our search for truth, for understanding. Too often we assume that the light on the wall is God. But the light is not the goal of the search. It is the result of the search.

""The more intense the search, the brighter the light on the wall. The brighter the light on the wall, the greater the sense of revalation upon seeing it. Similarly, someone who does not search, who does not bring a lantern with him, sees nothing.

""What we perceive as God, is mearly the by-product of our search for God. It may simply be an appreciation of the light, put and unblemished, not understanding that it comes from us. Sometimes we stand in front of the light and assume we are the centre of the universe - God looks asstonishingly like we do. Or we turn to look at our shadow - and assume that all is darkness.

""If we allow ourselves to get in the way, we defeat the purpose. Which is to use the light of our search to illuminate the wall in all it's beauty and in all its flaws, and in so doing better understand the world around us"".

Then there's these quotes:
""If I project a beam of light at the wall, you see the light on the wall, but the wall is not the source of the light. It comes in from somewhere else. The soul is also a projection. It does not exist inside us any more than the light exists inside the wall. But this .. shell is the only way we can perceive it.""    
-- Lennier to Brother Edward in Babylon 5:""Passing Through Gethsemane""

""We believe that the universe itself is conscious in a way we can never truly understand. It is engaged in a search for meaning. So it .. breaks itself apart, investing its own consciousness in every form of life.""

My family spearheaded by my dad has always had this narrative I em a cry baby or I just make shit up or lie for attention or whatever when its totally the complete opposite I just keep everything to myself cause maybe I em wrong or other ppl have their problems to they don't need to be burdened with my problems 

For example as a child over at my aunt's house climbing on her monkey bars I kept falling but I kept getting back up and trying again the 3rd or 4th try I fell chest down landing on my arm on a rock I got up crying and screaming from the pain my mother ignored me told my aunt I was faking and continued the convo. They were having after a few mins of this my aunt stopped her I don't think he is faking took me to a doctor turns out I had a green limb fracture one of the most painful fractures you could have what the doctor at the time told us

Years later teenager then was having issues with my teeth tell dad and his current wife and they would say nothing and just look at each other for a bit and tell me not this month son ask next month I guess they hoped I would just forget? Idk but next month try again same story 3 months after the first time I tried I gave up and one day got up refused to go to school cause the pain was too much to bare dad looks at me and goes son you have to tell me these things or I can't help.......dad wtf are you talking about I have been telling you for 3 months and he just froze like he had this realization oh shit he is right

So I finally get taken to the dentist we go in get our teeth cleaned and I get x-rays of my teeth taken and they say I needed 900$ of work done as we leave dad turns to me and says sorry son we don't have the money 

see they were saving to go on a cruise dad had taken his previous gf on one and kept promising his current wife he would take her on one and that would have cut into that money I never tried after that years later in my 20s then me my brother and dad are talking and I bring up that story he just goes fucking nuts screaming in my face that never happened and I'm a fucking liar later on tells me it's ok son we just remember different things 

Or they constantly remove me from things that happened tell someone a story about the family and they will cut me out of it or fill me in with one of my brothers or he will just replace me in something that happened to me that he wasn't even there for 

Now I em a 30+ still living at home struggle with depression anxiety and the rest of the bs but I don't trust myself if I em even really experiencing these things or if those things are to do to the blow I took to the forehead as a child a blow hard enough I have had a indent on my forehead my entire life something I have read up on recently and learned that could actually explain some of my problems but then I question if that is right maybe my body already repaired the damage from that which no they never took me to the hospital when that happened and dad has told me his version of how that even happened his version is I walked up behind him when he was getting ready to throw his horseshoe I walked up behind him and that apparently had enough force to put an indent in my forehead for the rest of my life

Or the fucking chunk missing out of my left ear no idea wtf happened with that when I ask my mom she just laughs at me like I'm nuts like mom I clearly had a piece of my left ear removed either by something biting me when I was a kid or someone cutting my ear 

And now here I em an ""adult"" who has no self worth or self confidence, everytime I have clawed some of that back for myself something happens that kicks me back down again back into their hands and now I have a fucking book here if me venting and bitching even now stressing on if I should even post this but I need to stop before I keep going but reading this has been a relief to an extent knowing that other ppl have experienced things like this or worse and writing this has been some relief getting some of this out there , off my chest my poor friend is usually the one who gets all this which she encourages me to leave but at this point I don't know if I even can lol",,,1619304676,{},gvrc82h,False,t3_mxf4dl,False,False,t1_gvntsce,/r/AskReddit/comments/mxf4dl/what_is_the_most_toxic_thing_a_parent_can_say_to/gvrc82h/,1619321135,1,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

[],,GinjaNinja90,,,[],,,,text,t2_sqi39,False,False,[],"I’ve been working on the same for around 15 years now. It became easier for me when I realized (thanks to a great therapist) that I can’t control her or the type of people she brings around (no matter what those people have done to her own kids). Once that clicked, I started setting boundaries: what I refused to talk about with her, how I deserve to be treated, all the things I felt shouldn’t take place in my presence, I guess. It didn’t go over well at first! She was the worst during that time-pushing the boundary to see if I was serious I guess. 

Some days, it feels like it works so well then other times it’s like she just doesn’t get it...or care. During those times, I cut off the convo because it throws me into a situational type depression if I don’t. It’s rough like it takes me back to those times I felt so worthless. These times don’t happen that often anymore. It did happen recently, but before that it had been years. The difference this time was that I know she was just trying to pull me down. I’ve done well with my life and she’s living in a motel. She hates that I’m the only one of her kids that “made it.” Once I realized that she just wanted me to feel as badly as she does, I wasn’t as upset with her anymore. She had her own issues. All this to say it’s not an easy fix. But it is worth it.

Your mental health is MOST important. Always protect that. If that means walking out when the gaslighting starts? Do it. If that means hanging up the call, do it. 

I live hours away now, but before I moved I always had an escape plan. I’d drive my own car to events so I could leave if I needed, only stopped in for short visits and used my dog as an excuse to get home, things like that. Now when I visit my family, I stay in a hotel and only see her for a little while. 

It’s really about keeping yourself as comfortable as possible. Because then you’ll be able to enjoy some things without always feeling scared/nervous about what she’s going to throw in your face. Because if you cut that out of the conversations enough times she’ll eventually give up that game. I found that not responding to my mom’s jabs and gaslighting makes her stop quicker. She can’t get angry if you just don’t engage. But make sure you have someone to vent to or some way to release all the anger afterwards. Bc it will still hurt and piss you off-just don’t let her see it.

You do not deserve to be treated that way. Don’t let her make you feel like you do. Remind yourself this every time you need to.

It’s possible to build a new relationship that works. But it won’t be like the mother/child relationships the lucky kids get (at least in my experience). However, it can be one that’s on YOUR terms. And that’s still pretty good, right?

It took years for me and some good therapy. If you haven’t, maybe look into therapy. That’s really what helped me keep my backbone. 

Remind yourself that you’re stronger than she could ever be. You’ve already been through hell, you can do this! And it’s 100% ok to go no contact for a while if you need the break, you’re not a bad child. She’s the problem, not you.

I know I just wrote so much, but it’s a lot to deal with. I’m similar to you where we can talk about day to day things, but if anything close to what happened to me comes up, I have to end the convo or I’ll shut down. My mom will never admit what happened to me bc that would mean admitting she’s wrong. She could never face that. I’m 31 and it’s still so hard to think about when it comes up. Because your mom is supposed to be the one to protect and love you! Not the one who throws you away. I don’t know if she and I will ever get to the point where it can ever be brought up in a healing type of conversation. Doesn’t mean it’s not possible, but she would have to make some changes first and that’s probably not going to happen. 

I do wish you luck and hey if you ever need someone to vent to, feel free to inbox me. I obviously don’t know your situation, but it does help to talk to someone who somewhat gets it.",,,1619304529,{},gvrby2w,False,t3_mxf4dl,False,False,t1_gvr7a5q,/r/AskReddit/comments/mxf4dl/what_is_the_most_toxic_thing_a_parent_can_say_to/gvrby2w/,1619320980,15,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

I don’t know if there’s an alternative but it has always rubbed me the wrong way that voters in New England and the South have the same influence over federal laws under which the voters of the West Coast also have to live, despite these regions being worlds apart in terms of culture, resources, values, and industry. 

Federal overreach has been unstoppable since the start, and I don’t think there’s any way to roll back focus to states’ rights. But honestly, if Alabama wants to teach creationism in their schools, fine. We’d cut off federal funding, but they can teach anything they want under private funds. If Florida wants to ban transgender athletes from competing alongside their aligned gender groups, go for it. Just don’t tell Oregon or Washington that they have to follow suit. There’s plenty of room in California for LGBT+ citizens (especially if we kick all the rednecks out of &gt;!you know which towns I mean.!&lt;) 

But seriously, we don’t all have to agree on literally everything to peacefully co-habit this pretty much underused space.

She used to live at one of the houses which was in a normal looking suburban neighborhood. The clinic was right next door. If you drove down the street they just looked like normal houses. But the neighbors were not to fond of the facility being there.

Anyway. She used to work the night shift every night. From 10 to 7. So I decided to get up early that morning drive over to where she lived and surprise her with some flowers. So I got there early and parked in front of a house next to the one she lived in. I waited about ten minutes and I see her leave the house she worked in and begin to make her way home. 
I get out of the car. Put the flowers behind my back. I shut the door. She sees me. I smile. She smiles delighted. I see two cop cars coming down the street at high speeds. I say oh shit. The cop cars pull up to me and two officers get out asking what I was doing there.

Something being natural doesn't mean that it is correct, morally speaking. There is absolutely no correlation between the two. Our reproductive organs exist so that we can procreate and generate healthy offspring. But I suppose you aren't against homosexual relationships, or the usage of condoms, or marriages involving at least one infertile person, just because said scenarios defy the way in which our bodies were designed, right? 

I really don't understand your comment about breast milk. Obviously, I am not against it. My opposition towards the consumption of animal based products stems from its negative consequences, all of which are non-existent when it comes to this practice. 

I also do not condemn the attitudes taken by early humans in order to survive and develop themselves. Just like any other wild animal, they had no choice, and eating meat was a requirement. But again, we are not in the Paleolithic. Currently, millions of people could switch to a plant-based diet, yourself included, probably. Not doing so is an irrational choice. 

Now, you also seem to believe that vegan diets are unhealthy. But [according to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19562864/), which is the [largest of its kind in the US](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Nutrition_and_Dietetics), ""appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.""

So it seems that the unnatural option is not only fine, but it may actually be overall healthier than an animal-based diet.

There is no argument against veganism, or at the very least vegetarianism, when it comes to people who are capable of switching to said diets. If you are fine with the grotesque price of consuming meat just because it tastes good, you are no better than someone who watches child pornography, supporting the suffering of innocent beings for your own pleasure.",,,1619304464,{},gvrbttp,False,t3_mxlkmo,False,True,t1_gvqaxu5,/r/AskReddit/comments/mxlkmo/whats_something_thats_always_on_your_mind_but_you/gvrbttp/,1619320915,1,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,
