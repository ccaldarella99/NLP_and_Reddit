Most people like to complicate it, but for weight loss It's energy in (calories of what you out in your mouth) versus energy out (total daily caloric need plus any additional burned). It doesn't matter if you eat a late snack or skip breakfast or all of that. There is a point of keto, but it's unnecessary to achieve results.

Energy In &lt; Energy Out - lose weight
Energy In = Energy Out - maintain weight
Energy In &gt; Energy Out - gain weight

As far as what's on the plate volume wise...

1/3 protein - white meat, eggs, and fish &gt; red meat
1/3 fibrous green vegetables - cruciferous is great imo, but spinach, asparagus, Brussel sprouts, etc. 
1/3 complex starchy carb - sweet potatoes and whole grains with germ

Fruit for snacks

Flavor with high-quality fats or get additional minerals and fats from nuts. Fats are important for hormones.

Get 30 minutes of exercise a day or average 3.5 hours a week mixed comprised of a mix of cardio (lowers resting heart rate = longer heart life) and anaerobic exercise (i.e. weight exercises) (more muscle mass = more caloric need). HIIT and calisthenics does great. I feel like it changes how my body makes use of the calories which is supported by how the body will use glucose first then fat as an energy source. When I was on it, I swear my body would not hold on to the calories from food, but thats not science even though there might be some backing up that feeling.

I remember decent chunks of my childhood so I should be able to give decent insight. 
I’ll start with your question to me, it’s not so much that I didn’t care about people because I did care a lot about very specific things, two things that come to mind is the movie Matilda and snail (I loved snail a lot lmao), it’s more that I didn’t really understand what other people were. To me they were just part of the background around me just another object that happened to do things that were helpful. They weren’t conscious beings in any way shape or form they just were. As I got older and started talking it made me realise that they were like me, they had thoughts to and disliked and liked different things, etc etc. This just became more apparent when I started have proper conversations and now I’m a very understanding person who can take others feelings and thought into perspective. I believe that a lot of how I felt about people was down to the fact I didn’t speak tbh but I also believe that my autism has other factors like preferring to be alone and doing things a certain way which in my mind other people could mess up.

As for the trauma and stable home life. My dad when he was around didn’t talk much either was always say in the corner on his computer (I was told this I don’t remember it) one thing I do remember is a singular argument which he left immediately after. During that argument I have no idea what was said at the time didn’t know it was even a fight because I was so oblivious and uninterested in what people had to say, I didn’t even know what emotions were. But after he left he never returned but I visited him a few times with my aunt and paternal grandparents but he was getting my brother to say nasty things to my mum so it stopped, never saw him again. The thing is tho I never even noticed all I knew was that sometimes some people took me out and that was it, if someone had to skip the visit I didn’t know so I don’t think that would have impacted me at all. (If it helps last I saw him was three years old so 15 years ago) that’s the only possible trauma I could have. My siblings could be very angry at times due to some of them having Aspergers but never towards people only objects, and again didn’t take any notice since in my head it didn’t effect me.

Trauma that I don’t know about is unlikely, I do have an extremely good memory for small details even years after something has happened and if there was something I would have repressed my mum is the type that would have put me in therapy to make sure I was okay

I grew up in north Idaho, it was, and still is to a lesser extent, a really racist place.  I can count on one hand the amount of black people I met growing up, and none of them stayed more than a couple of years.  Even now it is overwhelmingly white (hence the nickname “Whitaho”.

The racism I witnessed growing up was hardly ever overt, it was always treated as some kind of open secret.  You didn’t talk about it, but it was there.

My mom did her best to dissuade my sister and I from falling into that put, she’s a great person, and I’ve never seen her do anything even remotely racist, but it’s hard for a kid when all of your friends and their parents are constantly bad mouthing the “thugs” on tv, but when asked about it they insisted they weren’t racist, there were two types of black people, (n-words, and black people, that kind of stuff)

I held this belief until I was about 25 or 26, when I started working out of state and was exposed to a lot more racial diversity.  I met a lot of people in those days and made some friends.  I met a few people that were really cool and eventually I got comfortable enough with them to start asking questions.  Turns out all of the things I thought I had known about black people and Mexicans were pretty much lies.  I was mad at myself for years for being a bigoted, closed minded ass, and I’m still trying to work through a lot of my misconceptions years later.

I work with racists sometimes and it pisses me off.  Growing up in that environment and hearing grown ass men spouting that same bullshit just gets me fucking mad.

Tough to write about but a fair question. We were in NYC for treatment and we were staying at Hope Lodge, which is basically a free hotel and a very nice building at that. We walked to her treatments everyday. Well, I walked, Mom was in a scooter. I’ll never forget, whenever we walked, mom always went ahead a few hundred feet and waited for me to catch up then she’d go ahead again until we got to the doctors. It’s important to say that she had a tube inserted through her abdomen into her stomach because the tumor was so big, it blocked her digestive tract. All of her stomach juices kept producing but had no way of leaving her stomach due to blockages. The tube basically allowed her stomach to drain into a bag similar to a colostomy bag, except this was just stomach contents, like bile, mucus and acid. Before the drain, her stomach was so distended and she was in so much pain. We finally found a doctor who could do the procedure and it certainly made her life easier. I just had to empty the bag and clean everything a few times a day. But I gladly did it so she was more comfortable. This is just one of the myriad issues that cancer brings along. 

On the day of the accident, June 2, 2016, we were crossing 5th Avenue. We were actually coming back from a different doctor and had never taken this route before. As mom crossed at the corner, when she got to the other side, there was no ramp for the sidewalk. For whatever reason, it is in the center of the block, not on the corner, I believe it is to keep the pedestrian traffic central but again, I was behind her so I wasn’t even aware of anything until it was too late. Mon crossed and when she got the the other sidewalk, she was waiting since she had no way to get onto it without a ramp. At the time, I was using a cane while I waited for a spinal fusion surgery so I could o Lt go so fast. By the time I got to her, a Good Samaritan was helping her try to get the scooter on the sidewalk. When she rode along, she always kept the drain bag in the basket of the scooter. She got off of the scooter and the gentleman was trying to lift the scooter onto the curb when he accidentally hit the throttle, causing the scooter to lunge forward and pulling the tube right out of her stomach. Now this was stitched in and also had a balloon on the end which was meant to hold it into her stomach. All of it pulled right out. I absolutely panicked and started calling the hospital where she had the procedure because I knew that time was of the essence. I knew that a leaky stomach would lead to death anyway if not immediately taken care of. We went as fast as we could to the car, which was parked quite a few blocks away in long term parking. 
We got into the car and hightailed it to Teaneck NJ to the hospital where the procedure was originally done. The doctor who did it was actually working and met us in the emergency room. We had to go to this hospital because it was the only one within 200 miles that would do the procedure to begin with so we really had no option of going to a NYC hospital. Anyway, as we were there, mom asked for a bag to throw up in. This was very common and I was used to giving her over 15 bags a day. Basically anything she ate, came back up without ever really making it to her stomach. She only was able to keep down liquids so whatever she swallowed would eventually come up. So as I go to hand her the bag, she immediately throws up very red blood. And a lot of it! More than I’ve ever seen in my life and I’ve seen a lot. This went on a few times and the staff were really sort of shocked. They actually moved us into a private area because it was so bad. I knew it was not going to go well and I’m proud to say that I had the sense to call all 6 of my siblings and tell them to get to the hospital now but also had them all speak to her individually so they could say goodbye in case they didn’t make it in time (they made it). I also called her siblings and they were able to get there as well. The doctor called me out and explained to me that they could try to fix the tube but they had very little hope that it would save her and wanted me to make a decision. I explained that she was totally coherent and able to make her own decisions and that I would not take on that responsibility while she was able to make the decision herself. She ultimately decided that she was done fighting. I never imagined that on my watch. This all started at about 2 in the afternoon. My siblings were there by 6:30pm. Mom passed at about 5:30 the following morning. So, the stupid accident was a good deed gone wrong. But in hind sight, I’m sure it would have happened within a few days. There was just too much blood for it to not have been catastrophic.",,,1620094610,{},gwuyxj9,False,t3_n3tn2f,False,False,t1_gwujopc,/r/AskReddit/comments/n3tn2f/whats_the_last_thing_someone_said_to_you_before/gwuyxj9/,1620133737,12,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

First some background. I am a degenerate and a whole lot of my friends know this. This will come back to bite me in the but later.

We were on this trip with a few of our family friends one of the three kids going along with us (excluding my brother but he isn't relevant to this story) bets I can never get a girlfriend a while back.

I respond probably but he knows we are going on this trip and one of the three kids is a girl a year older than me. and he bets me to ask her out on the trip. I am a man of my word and I don't back down so I accepted it and I would've loved to have a girlfriend.

The trip comes and on the first day I try my best to ask her but the last kid keeps on bullying me saying random stuff and I wasn't dealing with that crap so I shoved him out of the room and very hastily and not in a good manner tell the girl the whole story to no response.

The next day I am nervous out of my mind and I am looking for an answer so we go to all of these places and we out by this waterfall on a frozen river and no one else is there besides us. I ask her what her answer was and she says this one word.

i come from a white south african family. the generation above me were all born during apartheid, and most of them were teenagers when it ended. almost all of us are fluent in English, Afrikaans, AND isiXhosa, which is fairly unusual for a white family.

it's always amazed me how people with the same upbringing can all turn out so differently. there's a pair brothers who i refer to as my uncles (they're actually distant cousins) who were raised on the same farm, are both polyglots, and who both continued working in agriculture for most of their lives. they're in their 60s now. I'll call them Uncles Mark and Greg.

Uncle Mark is the most racist person I've ever met in my life. I've heard him use the n-word. I've heard him announce on more than one occasion that south africa was better under apartheid. He speaks isiZulu and isiXhosa and he uses them purely to catch people out or gain the upper hand in conversations. He has a black maid from Zimbabwe who he underpays. I once asked him to teach me some isiXhosa and he asked me why i'd want to know such a trash language.

Uncle Greg on the other hand is the epitome of a reformed white man. Everywhere he goes, he greets people in their native language, or apologises if he can't. He speaks English, Afrikaans, isiXhosa, IsiZulu, and I think also some Khoekhoe. He refers to everyone, regardless of race, as ""my friend"", ""my brother"", or ""my sister"". I went grocery shopping once and he struck up a conversation with the Xhosa girl at the checkout, and ended up chatting with her for ten minutes because it turned out they were born in the same village and spoke the same regional dialect. He's given me lessons in isiXhosa and Afrikaans whenever I've seen him since I was five years old.

I did receive it as a birthday gift a few months later though. The second one was some one telling me some mega millions numbers; they’d previously won and helped a few others win so in the dream it was guaranteed. All I had to do was go buy the ticket. I woke up as I was in line to give my slip to the lottery cashier. It felt so real and easy, that for a few hours after I was awake I was giddy! Like, ok, I just need to buy my ticket with these numbers and I’m good to go, set for life! I did actually play the numbers, and won nothing.

I was jumped a lot. I was robbed a lot. I hated school because of it. Eventually, I started to just stay away from all black people. I didn’t want to talk to them or deal with them in any way. 

In high school, I was in a diverse community. I made friends with the white, Latino, and Asian kids but the mentality remained so I stayed away from black kids all together. I assumed the worst of every one that I met. If I had a group project then I volunteered to do all the work so I wouldn’t have to deal with them. I then met two of the sweetest women in my life in an AP class. They were sweet and intelligent while...... black. I fought it at first but then reevaluated my mindset.

So, I got on the internet in 95 and my racism was frequently obvious and I got called out on it.  I tried to defend myself but eventually I started to realize that maybe everyone wasn't unfairly accusing me of being racist, maybe they were right.

Then it would be fair to say that you do not know if your religion is objectively more true than any other. 

&gt; Josephus is probably the best resource I have found

They claim that Josephus cited Christianity twice in his writings.  One has been shown to have been fraudulently edited in by later writers, and the other is strongly suspected to have the same origin. Josephus is not a credible source, and there are no other contemporary sources for what should have been an important occurrence at the time.

&gt; there are small archaeological things

Like how Tyre would never be repopulated?  Or how the Exodus never happened?  Or how Sennacherib's prism does not prove or disprove any of the stories about the multiple seiges of Jerusalem?  Or how the Hittites having existed provides no enrichment whatsoever of the historical discourse?  Or how Noah's flood was not only an aberration for a loving god who created man with all his faults, but also a physical impossibility?  Or how the Romans would perform a census wherever the Isrealites happened to be at the time?  Or how all the other potentially verifiable events narrated in the bible have no historical, geological, or cosmological reflection in reality?

&gt;I hope this isn't too much of an answer

last november i got locked out of my house by my parents after an argument that started when i accidentally broke a glass. i ran to a neighbors house to ask for help and i called the police for the first time ever on my parents. after 4 hours of me waiting in a strangers house crying and feeling like i was gonna throw up, a white police officer finally showed up (where i live, theres almost only poc), he asked me basic questions and then he asked why i called. i tried to explain the situation, first i said that i called because i had an argument with my parents that day and that was the last straw for me, (im not sure if im explaining this right, basically i said i wanted to report things that happened before that, but the actual argument is what kind of broke me and finally made me decide to call). after i explained that i wasnt calling about something that specifically happened that day, he rolled his eyes and interrupted me and told me i had no visible bruises or cuts on my body so he was just going to take me home immediately (i was wearing sweats and a long sleeve shirt, literally the only thing visible was my head and hands). 

i was panicking and trying to explain and he just wouldnt listen, he finally pulled up to my house and i felt like my head was gonna explode, as a last resort i told him about something that happened to me when i was really young where i experienced sexual abuse from someone in my house and all he said was sorry but there was nothing he can do. i had to walk back to my house with him and my parents refused to open the door so the police officer yelled at them for a while and they finally opened the door and i went inside. as soon as i was inside my parents went on a rant about how i ran away for no reason and how they dont trust police officers and the police officer said he didnt trust them either and later he left.

i still have flashbacks about that all the time about it, sitting on a couch in some random house waiting for the police to show up, the ride back to my house, the moment i knew the police officer didnt believe me or just didnt care. my parents made me feel horrible after that and they said im lucky i dont get put into foster care and they told my entire family that i had run away even though they locked the door on me. obviously theres a lot more to that situation that i dont want or need to mention including the things that my parents did to me in the past but i think you can get a good enough understanding of what happened.

the funny thing is that i posted on here about everything i went through prior to that asking for help and every response i got told me to call the police or talk to an adult about it or something like that. 

from that day on i realized that im actually alone in this world. im literally the only person who will have my back, im the only person i can rely on. my parents think im mentally ill now. ive never wanted to not be alive more than now and ive never hated police officers more than after that and ive never felt more alone.

what i experienced probably is nothing compared to what the person im replying to but one thing i know for sure is that we both felt that same loneliness and realization that nobody really cares, or at least not enough to take you out of that situation when youre literally begging for it. all theyre there for is to collect a check and leave. they get tv shows and movies and books talking about how heroic they are. it felt like being stabbed, realizing that all of that shit was a lie. it genuinely broke me knowing i cant even rely on the police to protect me.

im sorry im really bad at explaining things effectively but at the same time i dont want to talk about anything it isnt necessary to talk about. but i think i really needed to at least try to desribe what that feels like, i think it permanently changed the way i looked at the world. nobody deserves to go through that, especially not on their own. i hope op is okay now, im assuming ur an adult now so i really hope that you were able to recover what you lost growing up with that.",,,1620094351,{},gwuyf9w,False,t3_n44yuf,False,False,t1_gwuobwn,/r/AskReddit/comments/n44yuf/exracist_people_of_reddit_what_changed_your_views/gwuyf9w/,1620133440,5,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

Last year during the first ever lock down - my partner of 5 years tried to strangle me when I was incredibly sick with fever and sore throat because he had himself convinced that I was just “pretending” to be sick with Covid to avoid making him dinner etc.

Tried to get his family to take him in; so he could have some space to calm down but they told me they couldn’t do that and if I was scared I needed to call the police. 

Really didn’t want to call the police as I knew he was mentally unwell but he was getting more and more worked up and after he strangled me for the third and final time I was just too scared for my life and I made the call.

I guess it wasn’t spoken to me directly but when the police were taking him away - the last thing I heard him say was “I just want to die”. 

That same day when victims services called me; I told them that I was incredibly concerned about him taking his life. They assured me that he was now getting the help he needed and that I should not contact him and just focus on getting better myself. 

Against my gut instinct I went along with these instructions and a few weeks later I got a knock on my door from the police to say he had indeed taken his own life. 

Never known pain like that. Feel like I failed him, and even though ppl have assured me it wasn’t my fault; I know in my heart that me calling the cops and going no contact was the reason “he wanted to die” and ultimately led to him killing himself. 

A few days before he suicided - I had the overwhelming urge to break contact and text him saying “Hey buddy, just want you to know that I don’t hate you, it’s hard right now but things will get better. Me and (our dog) love and miss you.” I never ended up sending it, because friends and family talked me out of breaking contact. Cannot help thinking though that he might still be alive if I had just reached out and sent the damn text.

Hurts so much that he probably died believing no one cared about him.

Despite its flaws, the ACA really reset the  status quo for American healthcare, where even under the subsequent Republican administration, they didn’t get rid of it, and there is bipartisan consensus on preexisting condition coverage. 

Foreign policy-wise, his most consequential move was the pivot to Asia, which long-term will be crucial in countering a rising China. Opening relations with Cuba was big, as was diplomacy with Iran (though that was all but completely undone and then some under Trump). In fairness, he inherited a bad hand with the wars, the withdrawal from Iraq and lack of engagement in Syria led to the rise of ISIS, the Arab Spring made the region a lot more chaotic, and the one area he did engage heavily in is Afghanistan - which I believe is a war that will age badly. 

On a plus side, he did have Osama bin Laden killed, which wasn’t a policy so much as a historic accomplishment. 

I don’t think he went into the job with a healthy appreciation for how much bad faith his opposition would operate in. He seemed genuinely blindsided by Trump’s election. His party got obliterated on the state levels during his time in office, which has had sweeping policy consequences. He underestimated Russia, and in Syria, Crimea &amp; Ukraine ended up with a short end of the stick to Putin. And while his legislative record was arguably the most accomplished since LBJ, there was still a lot more that could have been done if they were willing to go there (ie abolishing the filibuster back then).

This gave him some pretty deep-seated issues towards black folks and I'd basically given up on trying to talk him out of it.

Eventually my cousin started dating a black guy named David and he didn't have any living direct relatives, so he came to join us for Thanksgiving and such, and he's a really nice, well-spoken guy so he was sort of tolerated as ""one of the good ones"" by my relatives with some racism still in them (still not a great, but progress). My uncle still didn't really like him, but he didn't say anything negative about him.

What really turned his opinion around was when this cousin was sexually assaulted by somebody, and before my uncle had even found out Dave and one of his friends went and beat the tar out of that guy. I currently live on the other side of the country from my family so I didn't hear about it till I went home on the next Christmas, but ironically that violence really did something to break down my uncle's hatred towards black folks.

David and my cousin aren't dating anymore, but David still comes to family gatherings and we see him more often than we see her. Even my grandpa and grandma are noticeably less racist because of being able to consistently interact with him and sort of remove the perception they have of black people being so different from them.

Dad was extremely racist against everyone but hid behind the ""I'm just being real"" or ""I'm an equal opportunity offender"" or the ever classic ""I just don't have a filter and it's not my fault if they're thin skinned"" excuses. 

It didn't help that I was also in a private school that was 99% white and hilariously enough didn't realize I was the odd one out. Even more ironic is I was huge into rap at the time, being late 90s early 00s. Mom's a grab bag of random European lineage and Dad's from New Delhi. You somehow never see what's right in front of you but that's a whole different story about my own identity crisis later on.

Anyway, it took until I had left the private school and went to a very much not 99% white public school and had a heck of a culture shock. Things were not helped when I then withdrew, hard, and got lost in MMOs and oh boy did you know there's a lot of racists that play video games on the internet? Yeah I met with a bad group that was even worse and fell down the rabbit hole hard. Eventually a friend just flat out told me dude, you are going to have an AWFUL time when you leave your room and get back into the world and have been in a racist echo chamber for too long. I dismissed this for a while until I did get back into the world again and met with a really diverse group. I held these views in secret for a while and eventually started questioning them. 

The conclusion was that man oh man not just my dad but I myself was SUPER RACIST like DANG dude it was not good. The insidious part is how well pop kept it under wraps from my mom to the point that after she divorced the old drunk she was shocked when I made an off handed joke along the lines of ""yeah that sounds pretty much like dad"" when we were talking about the BLM movement, and the look on her face when I told her it had been pretty deeply imparted into me and is, in all honesty, still something I struggle with and have to be very conscious of, was almost enough to make me cry.

I just could never understand basing someone off the color of their skin. Sure, you can make quick assumptions perhaps, but genuinely thinking all x people are this, I just stopped making those sort of jokes.

[],,007dust,,,[],,,,text,t2_7l9zo,False,False,[],"When my mom moved me from Maine to Virginia in 1978 when I was 9 after my dad died.

She ripped me from everything I knew and drug me to this hellhole full of backwoods racists and rednecks. I went from what I knew as a ""normal"" living to a single room shack that barely had electricity. I had to start using an outhouse, had to get our water from a spring, and had to heat that same water on a coal or wood stove to take a bath in a metal galvanized tub. We were literally living like it was 1930. I went from a straight A student to failing. Long story short, I resented my mother for years for bringing me here and it permanently damaged our relationship, (she's 75 now and it's still strained to this day).

This comes back on me 10 fold. Wanna know what happened? Read on...

Fast forward 32 years to about 2009-10, I had a shitty first marriage with my high school sweetheart, (colossal whore who even had a kid by someone else while we were together). I married again with a completely distorted view of love and relationships which led to me becoming my first wife reincarnated, (I cheated on her terribly). My mother had a good relationship with my wife and saw right through my BS when it was at it's worst, so she slowly started telling her just what a piece of shit my father was and that she didn't have to take my shit, that she deserved better, (he mentally abused her the entire time they were married and most likely cheated too). My wife tells me this and it completely rocks my world. Mom had led me to believe they had a perfect relationship, that they never fought or anything, and this was something that stuck with me for some reason and I kept wondering why my relationships weren't the same way, (I just assumed I was with the wrong person or was doing something wrong...I was). This was near the end of the cheating and I was mentally falling apart inside, (I was so full of guilt I had a complete nervous break and have never been the same since...Karma). Soon after I stopped cheating and months later I came clean to her and told her everything. I had slept with one of her best friends and several other women, (I banged my neighbor to start it off months after getting married, classy). My wife was destroyed and it took her a long long time to trust me again, but I was done and have never done it since. We got close again and things were going great...then she was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer, (she died 3 1/2 years later of liver failure in 2016). 

Karma is a mother fucker, lemme tall you.

I will never will be the same because of the roads that led me here and I am ridden with guilt to this day. I had a second nervous break last year and am most likely going on disability, (I can barely even be around people at all without my anxiety going through the roof). I have since remarried and am very happy, but the terror of Karma not being done with me because of all the shit I put my late wife through is always in the back of my mind. Mom has since slowly told insane stories to my sister and I about her life with my dad, it's mind boggling what she put up with. I look back at all this now with shame and regret and tell mom every time I speak that I love her, but like I said, the relationship will never be even close to normal. I went years without even telling her that, barely spoke to her, just didn't care. So go ahead, rip me a new one, I deserve all of it and will take it right on the chin.

TL;DR?
I was a shitty spoiled child who held a grudge against his mother for over 30 years, all because she wanted to leave a life of hell behind and come back home to her family while her parents where still alive.",,,1620094076,{},gwuxw4v,False,t3_n41exk,False,True,t3_n41exk,/r/AskReddit/comments/n41exk/what_minor_injustice_was_wrought_upon_you_as_a/gwuxw4v/,1620133123,1,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,
