I said born and raised not in a sense that I was sent to a Muslim-exclusive school where children are just taught about Islam, I learned about it by osmoses if I can say. I saw my father going to the mosque and I saw him praying. I saw women wearing hijab and I knew it exists and in this environment, it happened to be sunni so I was raised as sunni.

 When I went to school as in from 1st grade till 12th grade were taught the usual things math, science, history, and one Islamic culture which is teaches you how to pray, fast, wash for prayer, among many topics a Muslim should know. My country of birth has like 90% Muslims and around 10% Christians so Christian boys and girls didn't have to attend the Islamic culture class.

 At uni I studied more about Islam. I went to Muslim college which next to my major classes (computing) I was given few classes about Islam such as Quranic studies, hadith studies, Islamic creed, Islamic jurisprudence, etc. 

 Islamic creed is something you should read more about to further understand the sunni vs Shia thingy.

 Islam is a religion that was revealed over 1400 years to a community in Arabia. Islamic sects formed as time passes due to different interpretations of the quran, the hadith, and not surprisingly politics. At the beginning Muslim were one nation, one unit and due to some political differences over which companion of the prophet should lead Muslims before the other separation happened. Shia are the people who supported Ali (prophets mohammed's cousin) and his children in becoming the leaders of Muslims while the majority wanted Othman (a companion of prophet mohammed) to be the next caliph. Since then it's been two big groups and they diverged as the time passes not only politically but from an Islamic point of view to the point that some Shia sects believe in things the sunni totally don't believe in. Things I would rather not to dicuss. 

 Basically, it started with political differences and eventually became different religious believes.

---------|----------|----------|
Did it at least cure your various mental illnesses?|Nope still in and out of the hospital frequently :/|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mz46ey/i_lost_the_last_2_years_of_memory_due_to_shock/gvyijrr/)
what was your reaction to the virus as you heard of it? or did you knew it before?|Virus?|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mz46ey/i_lost_the_last_2_years_of_memory_due_to_shock/gvynwfs/)
Wow! I'm sure in the near future electroshock  therapy will be looked at similarly as lobotomies and bloodletting. I'm sorry for your experience. Have you looked into any holistic treatments for your illnesses?|Yeah I am currently doing animal therapy and training my puppy to be a service dog. It works much better than zapping my brain|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mz46ey/i_lost_the_last_2_years_of_memory_due_to_shock/gvyjfa5/)
How did you end up embarking on that form of therapy? Sometimes I feel would not mind erasing part of my memory, pretty much any part of it as long as it was a large enough chunk.|I was in the hospital and constantly being put in restraints because I was trying to kill myself it was a bit of a last resort. Believe me loosing your memories is not as fun as it sounds. Lost so many good memories. Entire people are gone from my memory|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mz46ey/i_lost_the_last_2_years_of_memory_due_to_shock/gvyq3ua/)
Do you think electroconvulsive therapy is ethical and has it helped you in anyway? By the way I‚Äôm really sorry you have to go through this and that you‚Äôve actually lost memory! :(|Yeah its tough to say. It really does help people but for me it didn't. I'm also kinda sad because I was a minor and I don't remember starting the treatment. My parents were the ones to give consent even though now 1/2 a year later I am 18 and dealing with the consequences myself. A girl contacted me and apparently we were close friends a year ago and I can't remember her at all. It breaks my heart when I have to tell someone I don't remember them|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mz46ey/i_lost_the_last_2_years_of_memory_due_to_shock/gvytg3k/)
what‚Äôs the last thing you remember?|Probibly being at my friends cabin and doing the polar plunge... Not very significant but at least a happy memory|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mz46ey/i_lost_the_last_2_years_of_memory_due_to_shock/gvyrpm9/)
Did it just feel‚Äù8‚Äôe you wake yme randomly after this day?|No more of a gradual haze over the 2 years it gets thicker in the middle. I can remember a few things from two years ago but entir epeople and places are completely gone from my memory. Really weird having someone you dont know/recognize tell you that you are best friends. My short term memory is still foggy to this day|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mz46ey/i_lost_the_last_2_years_of_memory_due_to_shock/gvyuarh/)
Was it voluntary ?  I heard people who have been treatment resistant with everything else  will seek it out as a last resort treatment option.  Did get any benefit from it?  How many times did you have it done?  Was the memory loss gradual or did it happen immediately after having it done ?  How are you now?   I‚Äôm a life long sufferer of multiple mental illnesses myself. Which went untreated for most of my life. I often see myself getting to this point and having to have ect done.|I didn't choose to do it my parents did. I was 17 and didn't get to choose  I had around 10-15 sessions with anistesia  It happened gradually as I had more and more sessions  I am not great now. 1 week ago I was In an ambulance after stabbing myself but I'm okay now|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mz46ey/i_lost_the_last_2_years_of_memory_due_to_shock/gw01eq3/)
Do you notice if any of your values or opinions about things have changed? Or are those lost too?|No it's more like it feels like I'm a complete different person from myself those 2 years|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mz46ey/i_lost_the_last_2_years_of_memory_due_to_shock/gw08kkl/)
What was your first thought when you started going through photos on your phone?|I had trouble not crying. I was in pictures with people and places I don't remember. I couldn't help but feel like I'd lost something. It's also a but confusing|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mz46ey/i_lost_the_last_2_years_of_memory_due_to_shock/gw0b0t3/)
What mental illnesses do you have, and what treatments/medications have you tried before?  (Not trying to be invasive, I‚Äôm just also mentally ill and curious lol)|I don't have definitive diagnosis but most likely MDD GAD EDNOS osme sort of trauma thing BPD  I tried 4 different meds before ect|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mz46ey/i_lost_the_last_2_years_of_memory_due_to_shock/gw0l083/)
Hello! Wish you good luck with whatever you want to do!  Questions:  1. Because your parents put you through this, do you hate them or do you think that they tried their best and didn't know about the consequences  2. Are there any info that you still remember? Like what you learned in school or something like that  3. Did you tell to your friends about the amnesia?  Hope that my questions aren't bothering you in any way and I'm sorry if I made some mistakes, english isn't my first language|1. Im sometimes frustrated with my parents choosing to do ect, but they were just desperate. It was to the point that if I wasn't on 24/7 observation in a hospital I would die. I understand they were just trying to help  2. I remember some school things but I have to re learn a lot of things. I'm taking a math course this summer and I'm terrified because I have forgotten what I learned in algebra 2 and i am worried ill have to learn it all over again. The only things I remember are very traumatic events and only like bits and pieces like a puzzle 2ith like only one piece in the right place. I remember a few of my suicide attempts those two years but not much else  3. I only tell people when it applies and I honestly don't have many friends at this point...|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mz46ey/i_lost_the_last_2_years_of_memory_due_to_shock/gw0yhmx/)

I moved in with my grandparents at the age of three (biological mom relapsed and passed away, and my dad started using again after that. So he dropped me off at my grandparents.) At age 12 I was taken from my grandparents due to sexual assault charges on my grandfather, and I was placed with my dad and uncle. Since I was placed with family, CPS didn't actually have to check the house or anything... Which is hilarious, considering that they had some of their equipment literally sitting out on the tables outside haha. Literally just covered by the wooden gate. 

It was awful though, honestly. My uncle didn't believe me about the SA charges, and that showed through with how he treated me. I ate exclusively at school, because he never really bought food. My dad would leave for month at a time, only to show up for a few weeks and leave again. After the power was off for a month he took me to live in an office building, but ended up taking me back. I didn't really know what was going on. They always lied to me and said they were making hydrochloric acid to melt down computer parts, and I never thought much else of it. Honestly, there was so much stuff that happened there, it's hard to summarize it all in one reply. I shared a wall with the lab itself and drank out of the beakers they used to cook, so I was absolutely on meth without even realizing it. I felt paranoid 24/7, and I didn't even know why! 

I ended up getting removed after making an offhanded joke to my therapist. Something along the lines of ""Yeah when I first moved in I thought they were making cocaine or something haha."" Turns out I wasn't too far off. She had me describe my thought behind it a little more, and the next day there were cops at the door. I sent them away the first time because there was nobody else home, and I told them I was just joking and that my therapist was just too concerned. The next day they came back, and they had me get an adult. I got this guy (Jeff I think his name was? Just some friend of my dad's who used too.) And from then, it's history. I moved in with my foster parents at 16, and I'm the happiest I've ever been! :) 

Cops suck though. I could write a book about the 12 hours I had to sit outside with them :/ that was awful. The whole experience left me with a lot of shit, but I'm just happy I'm at where I'm at.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc!""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&amp;c.**, **&amp;c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc!""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&amp;c.**, **&amp;c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc!""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&amp;c.**, **&amp;c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

I think financial aid, while unpopular the Covid bill (that was very frustrating as a conservative...) and I would also argue government loans to corporations, tax relief plans, church no taxes and while unpopular I am ok ending social security as long as people get the cash they paid in. I also think unemployment should be an employer thing. Severance used to be very common and should be 1 week paid per year with the company 
Starting at 1 week. Maybe some assistance but not a ton. 

I am sorta against government paid shelters (but
We need to lock up domestic abusers) and government money for children and abortions (especially). I would also cut funding for private schools, I don‚Äôt think public schools should pay for sports and I think that they should remove any form of government subsidies (farming, and cash for the poor and such) food stamps and I‚Äôm ok with a tax break on green energy and a tax on pollution. Public transit should go the way of the dodo bird, if it‚Äôs not profitable. 

Now yes, my school plans seem a bit strange but we need to help highschool students learn to take care of themselves. Cook, setting personal appointments, going to the doctors regularly ect. And hygiene should be part of that. Abolish common core and implement these to replace the other electives in public and voc schools.

Basically curious on your thoughts about continued smoking and it's effects when you stop. Sure it's all fine and dandy to smoke every day, it brings people a lot of joy but it's the repercussions when you have to stop that I think people neglect to mention. It's the same as any other drug if you use it on a regular basis you will become dependant on it. The mood swings and general withdrawals. It's held me back for years now and it makes me really sad. I find myself far too dependant on it and when I stop I get sad so I want more because I'm sad. It's a never ending addiction circle. 

So for example do you limit yourself to a certain amount each day as not to overdue it? Do you pay attention to the CBD to THC ratio since it's the CBD that gives the help most people are looking for (i.e. anxiety and depression). These days where weed is legal they've made it so consumerised that it's all about crazy high THC which is also a reason people end up hooked on it because it's far too strong for what it should be. 

I dunno, theres just a very tiny glimpse of my opinion on weed. I love the drug and it has incredible good qualities for definite. For depression it helped me so much but it also hinders my growth an awful lot too. I wish people spoke more about the cons openly rather than just push the pros and make people believe it's a wonder drug that can be abused with no repercussions.

Though they should go together. I also think the social officers should have a taser to protect themselves and maybe a thing of concealed body armor. 

Another example of fiscal end is healthcare. I believe the government should only provide it for those who cannot work, retired or recently unemployed, I think companies should be required to, and we need more regulation in regard to abusing the part time system. 

The corporate tax laws are abused and need to be reformed to protect the individual and frankly we need to work on making sure individuals can‚Äôt dodge taxes.

Politicians shouldn‚Äôt have lifetime salaries and getting cash from companies or ‚Äúgifts‚Äù should be cracked down on.

   Then I found Nardil. After I got it, I had to wait for a full six weeks (with fingers crossed) for it to work, but when it did -- holey moley -- the effect it had was astonishing. It vaporized my depression/social anxiety combo like a scrap ship around the perimeter of a south pacific nuclear test site. Finding Nardil was like finding the freakin' Grail. I found myself thinking things like ""Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, I'm free at last!""    
  
   Yessir, Nardil made a HUGE impression on me when I first took it. It energized me and allowed me to feel better than I'd ever felt as an adult. It's tough to describe in words what it was like to have the ability to go to parties and participate in things like play-acting games -- to have the ability to let go, forget , act silly, and join in the fun. It was also awesome to have a group of friends throw me birthday parties for the first time in my life (because I actually had a bunch of friends to throw it.) And I could carry on conversations without feeling awkward, constantly thinking about myself, and wondering what to say. And it was great being able to go to job interviews without having my heart pound out of my chest, my palms sweat buckets, and my voice quaver.    
  
   I thank God every day for discovering this miracle drug. I can finally live a normal life! I encourage you to do your own research and not always rely on advice given by doctors. I think it's a true shame that Nardil is not prescribed often as a result of outdated and irrational fears of the dietary restrictions. MAOIs are strong anti-depressants, and Nardil is particularly great for social anxiety as a result of its effect on GABA.    
  
   Unfortunately, very few doctors could ever tell you about it. Nardil is like the best kept secret for social anxiety! I actually found it on my own through research. These sites have a whole lot of information and consumer experiences that no doctor will tell you. I strongly encourage you to do your own research. A good site to begin with is https://nardil.org which I found to be quite helpful. I have nothing to sell - I simply want to help others, so I created this site :)    
  
   Many people have the exact profound experience as I did when every other medication failed.

She was pretty well born a ""normal"" preemie. She was pretty small and had to have a feeding tube for the whole time she was in the Nicu. She had 24-hour care from nurses while there, and they gave us good feedback and suggested that she was a pretty good baby. She almost never cried while she was there and she didn't seem to mind the feeding tube. Other than watching the kidneys right now, she seems to be doing well with no other issues.

The Nicu was kind of an interesting experience, we learned a lot because when we went to go feed her or change her the nurses would come over and walk us through it giving us pointers, if they saw we were struggling they would come over and help us.

A little while later an ultrasound was done which showed excessive fluid behind the neck, which is an indicator of down syndrome or many other problems. We were sent to a specialist hospital and a second specialist hospital for children, where my wife had an amniocentesis so that more genetic testing could be done. It was three-part testing the first one took about a week to get results the second one about 3 to 4 weeks and the last one was supposed to take about 4 to 6 weeks but ended taking 8 weeks. Again all this testing came back normal with the exception of a couple things that they referred to as ""normal variation"".

The variations, one was a duct that entered the heart and the other was a narrowing of the tube that comes off the kidney that brings urine to the bladder.

After birth the duct to the heart didn't matter because it wasn't being used anymore, but as for the kidneys she gets regular ultrasounds every 3 months just to watch them but so far so good.

Around the 34 week mark my wife had an ultrasound and it showed the baby at x weight I don't really remember. She had another ultrasound done at the 36 week mark where they found that the baby's weight had only increased by a small amount, when they were expecting significant growth. That's what led to having a next day c-section and delivering the baby early.

Our daughter is still really small, she's nearly 5 months old and only 12 lb, but she does look like she's very long. As far as we can tell she's a healthy baby just the one thing to monitor. We got pretty lucky.

Overall she's been a pretty good baby, she's my first child so I don't have anything to compare to. But she has slept really well, she fuss a little bit when she's feeding which she's starting to get over, and she's starting to get more and more fun. She just hit a bit of a sleep regression right now, it's somewhat mild but I might eat my words pretty soon.

The hardest part lately of having a baby has been doing it during covid.
