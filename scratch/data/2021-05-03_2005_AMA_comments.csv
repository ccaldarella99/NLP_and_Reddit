Not true, and that's an outright stupid take. The US spends more on healthcare than any other country on Earth (both in absolute numbers and in relative numbers), so your logic doesn't hold on (if the problem is that ""the US doesn't have money for healthcare"", how is the US spending the most money on healthcare?). The problem has nothing to do with what the US spends on other countries protection, it has to do with your parties being little bitches to companies. You could regulate the market and have an efficient and free healthcare system, you just choose not to. And that ""you"" includes you. You are here on reddit convincing yourself that free healthcare is impossible because you've been told not to want that.

On the topic of the ""US protecting other countries"", that's bullshit. In the XXI century, no country will go to war with European countries, not even Russia. The US spends egregious amounts of money on the military because they want to funnel money to the war industry, and then cover it up pretending it's ""to protect Europe"". Denmark needs no protection from daddy US and so, the money the US spends on defending Denmark is exactly $0. The money the US spends for other reasons that it calls ""defending Denmark"", that's another issue.

The energy amplifier event also helps to boost the use od shield characters on the twisted realm which i really appreciates it as big C6 noelle and zhongli mains myself.

But one thing thats really pisses me off other the the heralds in the new spiral abyss is that mihoyo purposefully holds out on the lore of the main story on the new zhongli quest.

Not only that it gave me a false hope which is the last thing that i need when im pretty disappointed with archon story quest when we met our lost sibling way too soon.

The idea of excuses to holding out the lore about what happens to khaen'riah really messes the story for me... As a whale, i don't mind spending a huge amount of money into this game because i was really invested with the character's story and their gameplay. 

However, it almost felt like the whole time i was grinding and spending was kinda pointless, because i felt i kinda waste my money and time for a game with bad story.

Fortunately, noelle's second hang out quest and this new event kinda gives more reason to play, at least until the chasm is released on 1.6
Then i might reconsider whether i should continue playing the game or not...

We chose to live here because the hotel has a manager's apartment, which became available as our previous manager (my mom's old boss) found a new home nearby. My mom was hired as an assistant manager, and our rent was extremely high since it's such an expensive area and we are far from rich. So we took the manager's apartment and we've lived there since. She's now the General Manager as her former boss wanted to get a job on our sales team instead.

I already got him since his 1.1 first release as my first limited 5 star characters before jean and diluc in the standard banner. 

Loved him all the away because im a shield hero fan lol

&gt;Do you also harbor a grudge towards Jean because you got her instead of Zhongli, what about Keqing?

I only bear grudge against jean in terms of lore, im a big noelle and ironically enough despite jean being her role model she's the sole reason why noelle have yet to join the knights.

She's an acting grandmaster yet all she do is finding missing cats and doing random errands yet she hasn't evaluate a potential great candidate like noelle properly, talk about poor management skill and overworked.

Overall in terms of gameplay, she and keqing is a bit over hype since kaeya actually does more damage than them as a sword users by far in terms of normal attack and E when they're on the same level.

And as for keqing, she is actually fine. 
She has a fun gameplay, but not necessarily as OP and statisfying as diluc and xiao though 
I just hope she wasn't my 50/50 when im pulling for ganyu though

&gt;Why can't I get Zhongli?

This is actually complicated question, how much is your pull from your last 5 star in the limited character right now?
Your chance of getting a 5 star is between 75-90th pull from your last 5 star, a good rule of thumb that i usually do is to do a single pull after my 70th pull.
I got xiao and childe thanks to this trick

And if you fail 50/50 your next 5 star will be guaranteed be the 5 star in the banner. 

&gt;Also why pay for stuff, the game is free? My sister does these thing called welkin moon or something, where she pays for some monthly things, but I don't understand why.

I have good job with decent pay, at first i was so impressed by the game that buy the starter packs and the welkins out of appreciation and to enjoy the game by Pay to win. 

 i was planning to make every characters in my account to be the best by maxing their stats out but turns out the resources necessary to build them up requires a bit of money.

Not to mention, you'll need welkins to actually be able to afford intertwined fate per day, else the primogems in this game would be pretty scarce.
Especially when you're already explore everything on the map till 100%

I'm going to suggest seeking help there. I've been doing NA myself, and I'm coming up on 6 years clean. Before I started going to meetings, anytime I tried to quit cold turkey it was so utterly miserable that I fell back into using. Even if you're not using now, sounds like your circumstances are enforcing that; it won't last.

There are some parts of it I'm not thrilled with (the religious-lite philosophies mostly), but the loving , supportive environment of the fellowship and the deep introspection and healing driven by the 12 step process has had a tremendous impact on me.

I bring this up because for me, addiction drove my depression. It wasn't just the impact of the chemicals on my brain, even during periods where I stayed clean-ish on my own, my ability to just do life was diminished. My coping skills were just getting high, my every day life was a roller coaster of messed up emotions, which always drove me back to drugs.

When I finally got clean for real and was going to meetings, early on I was convinced I needed anti depressants. However, after a while I just got drastically better, simply because I was working on healing and living a better life, with the love and support of others.

NA is not the only option. There are 12 step Whatever Anonymous groups for anything and everything under the sun. There is Refuge Recovery (Buddhism), SMART recovery (CBT), and many others. My point is working on your addiction can have tremendous benefits.

They said they liked my work but couldn't hire me until I had a degree but they had a bureau in the city I was studying in and offered a freelance position. Worked that job while I was in college and got a dual major in broadcasting and foreign languages. That full time job never came but one day after college someone from CNN called asking if I was interested in freelancing for them and had heard my name through other people on TV. I gladly accepted. The job was pretty much the same, but the buttons were in different places. Over all glad I did it while I was young and ambitious

---------|----------|----------|
what is DID ?|DID is a disorder characterized by the presence of two or more distinct personality states.  Dissociative identity disorder, previously called multiple personality disorder, is usually a reaction to trauma as a way to help a person avoid bad memories. Dissociative identity disorder is characterized by the presence of two or more distinct personality identities. Each alter has a unique name, personal history, and characteristics.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwoxdiw/)
What is a DID system? I've heard of the condition but not a system?|A system is what happens when a person has DID. The personality doesn't fully integrate so it becomes many personalities. The many personalities are called a system. Does this make sense?|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwoxi1c/)
When did you first realize you were in a system?|Note I am a newer alter so I asked the core.  She said that she knew that something was different for years but didn't know what it was. Our parents made us go to therapy after some things hadn't been going well. Everest is an alter who is fascinated by psychology and he came across DID when reading a textbook, and he asked our therapist about it. That was when we realized that we are a system.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gworp20/)
How many is there currently in your system?  Is your current host the original host?  Has anyone in the system experienced integration yet? If so, are you able to tell me about that experience?|There are 16 that we know of,  The current host is not the original host,  None of us have integrated nor do we want to.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwoulaj/)
Who is the youngest|We don't say any of our littles names. The youngest little is 3-4 years old. That is all I will say.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwotsqd/)
What would you say is the most difficult aspect of having DID|Happy cake day.  The most difficult part of DID I would say, is not being able to spend as much time as I would like doing things I like.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwp0bjc/)
Do the alters have different IQs? Like if one studies for an exam, and a switch happens during the exam, what happens? (I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs called a switch, sorry if it‚Äôs not the right word)|Switch is the correct word. I wouldn't say we have different IQs necessarily, however when you have a 3 yo and a 20+ yo in the same head, things are different. My system has decided that certain alters are responsible for different classes. I (Elliot) am responsible for math, science, and STEAM. Everest is responsible for english, history, and art. Ghost is responsible for all other classes. This helps prevent us from switching during exams, if we do switch we have accommodations to help us.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwp4dc9/)
I really don‚Äôt mean to be rude but is each personality sort of like a different person? Are each of you aware of this?|Each alter is a different person. We are all aware that there are other alters, most (all but 2) are aware that we have DID.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwp5o4l/)
Is there a hobby or interest that one alter is passionate about that the others aren‚Äôt into at all?|I (Everest) play trumpet, the others don't play and don't like to play. We have a horse and compete with it and only a few of us ride/ take care of him.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwpi42e/)
How do you decide who to tell about your DID and who to not tell?|Every alter is different. We dont generally tell people unless we will be working closely with them for an extended period of time.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwqkrk3/)
What does it feel like when you switch and are no longer the host?  Where do you go and what do you see?  I‚Äôm sorry if that sounds ignorant, I‚Äôm just not sure how else to word it.|It isnt ignorant, it sounds like it is coming from a place of genuine curiosity and we are willing to answer any question if it is from a place of genuine curiosity. Every switch is different, some are extremely rapid and you wont notice, and some take minutes. We go to the headspace. It is a castle with different areas, alters are limited on where we are allowed to go. As the host I am only allowed on my corridor. There are other alters rooms, and those alters I have good communication with. If I switch with Mike I will have hime answer.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwql1vg/)
Is there a ‚Äúmain‚Äù personality? Are you the ‚Äúmain‚Äù personality?|The ""main"" personality is called the host. The host is the person that fronts most. I (Everest) am a co-host and a protector.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwqmauj/)
How do you feel the media illustrates DID and do you feel it is realistic (like the movie Split)?|We hate it. We haven't watched Split, nor do we want to. From what I have heard, they portray systems as serial killers or narcissistic, and we would never do that. Because of our trauma and genders/sexualitys we are more likely to fall pretedor to both of these.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3be0g/i_am_part_of_a_did_system_ask_us_anything/gwqmhix/)

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&amp;c.**, **&amp;c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

(We currently don‚Äôt have the best of the best when it comes to a GM) Me being a front desk agent and barely having any clean rooms to give our reservations, I decided to go out and clean a few rooms myself. I may had spent about an hour on one room but I would periodically go check the front office to make sure no one was waiting for me (I should also mention that I work alone on the second shift). 

During this time I had encounters with two angry people, one angry because she needed a two bed room but we only had a 1 bed available after she complained about her initial room because it wasn‚Äôt a smoking, and the other guy angry because I needed to put pillowcases on his pillows before checking him in to save him some time from coming back and complaining. 

Well after doing a really shitty job on making the beds, I went back to the front to check if anyone was there. Had a guy in the lobby waiting to get inside since the door was locked. I went inside and let him in along with another guest and did my best to explain the situation. Apparently the guy had been waiting there for an hour but I quickly called him on the bullshit since I‚Äôd just been at the desk not even 15 minutes ago.

So he decided me to get angry with me once I tell him we had no rooms available tonight. Usually that‚Äôs the part where guests feel like for some reason, they have to explain their plight and how much of an inconvenience you are because of their poor planning, which I understand in some cases but the guy was just a complete asshole about it. After he finished his rant and walks out of the door, I looked at the other guy and uttered ‚Äúanyway, what can I do for you?‚Äù

Of course this guy haaad to be within earshot of this, and comes back inside, puffs up his chest and starts saying ‚Äúwhat‚Äôd you say? Did you say anyways? I bet you won‚Äôt come from behind the counter and say it to my face. Matter fact, you go ahead and do that and I got something waiting for you in the trunk.‚Äù 

I‚Äôve heard threats like this so many times to the point where I‚Äôve been desensitized to it. So I just give him a blank stare before saying ‚Äúanyway.‚Äù Once again.

Instead of forbidding internet and social media,  young kids should not be left alone with it until they grow into it and demonstrate they can be responsible with it.
I compare it with streets and traffic.  No one would suggest to keep kids locked up until they are of age. Neither does one just send them out on a busy street alone to find their own way to the playground. 
Instead one starts by holding hand and quiet roads until they learn. One explains the dangers and safety rules slowly and in children terms as they grow up. And at a certain time one trusts them, allows them making small mistakes while still keeping an eye on them for a while. 

Same goes with internet and social media. Hand a mobile or browser to the five year old and then leave the room for an hour? Hell no! But sitting with me, reading writing on social media and explaining things? Yes.

There is - and has to be - a middle ground between keeping  internet away from kids and just handing it to them without limits and supervision. 

And while the dangers of the net do no doubt exist,  luckily they are usually not immediate and irreversible.  Might your 10year old learn about some topics a bit earlier than you anticipated? Yes. Is that bad? Only if left alone with it. It's up to the adults to teach .both about the things encountered but also that they should ask/talk about those things with you.

---------|----------|----------|
As many creepy and weird calls you get throughout the day, has anyone on the phone at your job actually managed to turn you on?|I‚Äôve been doing this for 6 years and have only ever actually gotten off with my caller maybe 4-5 times. It‚Äôs a very rare occurrence. It has to be a perfect storm. I have to be in the mood, the caller has to want to discuss things I‚Äôm into, have a sexy voice as well as they gotta be just as vocal with me as I am with them. It‚Äôs super rare but it has happened.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwoqgjl/)
What‚Äôs the weirdest thing someone asked of you?|Toss up between a guy who had a fetish for sneezing and wanted to hear me sneeze. Naturally, I can‚Äôt sneeze on command so I did everything I could. Finally when nothing seemed to work, he suggested using black pepper. I was blowing pepper of out my nose for like 3 days.  Or the guy who had probably the most sickening fetish I‚Äôve ever encountered. We wanted to roleplay a scene where I would mutilate his penis. He wanted me to describe the scene in vivid detail. I was so uncomfortable and felt sick, I didn‚Äôt care if it was money, I just hung up.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwnye81/)
Is it a satisfying job???|Absolutely. I work from home, in my Pj‚Äôs. I can do other things in between calls, I work as little or as much as I want to, and make a solid pay, even on slow days.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwnzj5u/)
How much do you make a day?|On the low end about $150-200. On the high end $500. Depends on call length, daily traffic, if goodies sell, if I receive tips, and how active my chat is that day.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwo13oo/)
Do you do erotic like ASMR?|I haven‚Äôt had a request for that, at least not yet. I‚Äôm also not certain my phone‚Äôs mic would be good enough quality to be considered ASMR. However if I did pre-recordings using my computer‚Äôs headset, I could totally get away with it. It would just have to be sold as recording as oppose to being done live over a phone call because I use my phone for work, not my computer.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwo14wg/)
Which platform?|Niteflirt|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwo9arw/)
What‚Äôs your favourite thing to be asked do?|I love when I‚Äôm told specifically to not be fake. I‚Äôm serious. Most girls on my platform have this persona built, and when I get a caller who wants to see more of who I really am, I can drop the whole nympho brat persona and just be me. I talk to them like a friend, and we build a genuine bond. That‚Äôs how you turn callers into repeated clients.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwogrfu/)
How did you get started doing this? How do you keep yourself safe? Do you have a separate phone to handle calls? Can you do it anonymously?|I got started in 2014, shortly after losing my dad. When I was let go with a bunch of other part timers from my part time job, I hit a major depression. This caused me to look for other avenues and stumbled across a forum about the various adult industries, phone sex included. So i did my researched, picked a platform and never looked back.  Keeping myself safe is easy. Any images on my profile do not reveal my face, and show zero identifiable markings. If clients ask where I‚Äôm from, I‚Äôll be honest and say the country I live in but nothing more. I never share personal information such as my last name, hometown, email, phone number etc.  I use my personal phone for calls because my company acts as a middle man. When I receive a call, I just see the company‚Äôs number. Just the same, my caller will only see my extension.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwohyvi/)
How does one get started !?|Do your research. Find a playform that you‚Äôre happy with. I liked my platform, Niteflirt because they‚Äôve been around the longest, they have the most amount of traffic and highest payout.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwoj73x/)
What is the salary or wage like as an operator?  What are your career plans?|I set my own price point. I charge a standard rate for phone at $1.99/min. I keep $1.26USD of that. If I put in the work, and with my experience, I can make 5 figures monthly, but my average is $4-6k monthly.  As for career plans, I‚Äôm still figuring that out right now. I‚Äôd like to get into social work eventually.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwpdgob/)
On NiteFlirt, some girls care about the rules and some will talk about whatever. Can NiteFlirt really know who ""breaks the rules"" about off limit topics? Do they record the calls?|I actually don‚Äôt know about that. I know girls can get in a lot of shit if they post about such topics on their listings but idk if they can get in trouble if it‚Äôs spoken about on the phone. Sorry :(|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwqd5zv/)
Buy gme ?  And you can do whatever you want.  r/superstonk|Huh?|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwqflm7/)
What is your sex or gender? Do you give out your name to anyone? Have you ever tried to meet up with someone through the service? And finally, are males on the service or is it just women?|I‚Äôm a female and identify as female.  I do use my real first name to avoid potential confusion when giving a fake name, but I don‚Äôt give out my middle or last name.  I have not and will not ever meet up with someone, that‚Äôs just against my personal comfort level, and of course for my safety.  Yes males are on the platform too, however it is dominated by females. There is money in it for men though I‚Äôm not sure how lucrative it would be, and I‚Äôm fairly certain most of your callers would be other men.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwqmmx2/)
Is there a market for men to do this? I'm hetero but I assume it would likely be gay men calling if anyone wanted to talk to men. Second question do you ever find yourself getting into it|Yes there is a market for men, though I‚Äôm not sure how big that market is. I also suspect you‚Äôre right, you MIGHT get a female call or two on the occasion, but I think a big majority of your clients would be other men.  And I have gotten into it. I‚Äôve done this for 6 years and have gotten off with a caller maybe 4-5 times. It has to be a perfect storm. I gotta already be in the mood, he‚Äôs gotta sound hot, be into all the same things I am and be just as vocal with me as I can be with him. However that is a SUPER RARE occurrence.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n37ffb/im_26_years_old_and_make_a_living_as_a_phone_sex/gwqvddz/)

---------|----------|----------|
I think schools should be required to do social media awareness seminars/classes and courses. Not just to address the potential for addiction - but to recognize the signs of grooming; where to report it or bullying etc; What's appropriate content to share online or not; the risk of hacking/online scams and many more related concerns. This is of paramount importance. We cannot prevent anyone from gaining access to the internet and social media. However, we can mitigate some of the harm it has the potential to do.   This is the age of technology and its irresponsible not to teach kids how to engage it. We don't need the kids to learn baking skills. They have YouTube for that.|This comment made me sad. And I don‚Äôt mean that to offend you it‚Äôs just indicative of where we are.  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need the kids to learn baking skills. They have YouTube for that‚Äù. You don‚Äôt think we, as a society and as people, lose something when our kids turn to internet strangers for help? YOU should be teaching your kid baking skills, not having them go watch YouTube videos on it for goodness sake|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwqwrp3/)
Great. Who enforces it, how do they enforce it, and how is the enforcement funded?|No clue. I‚Äôm sure every common sense regulation that we now take for granted began with a chorus of ‚Äúhow do we do that though?‚Äù.  Maybe it‚Äôll come in the form of all mobile devices having blocks on social media and you having to remove the child block with credit card info to prove, at the minimum, that you have a credit card.  Maybe when you buy your phones, it comes with some sort of software block you have to have removed there in the store by an employee who verifies you‚Äôre over 18.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwqv3t9/)
Would you feel differently if the school system started teaching social media? I personally think they should and very early on.|I dunno.  Social media is addictive. I‚Äôm not sure to what extent you can teach around that. Like would it be a fair trade off to legalise the sale of cigarettes to kids if we taught them about tobacco and addiction? I don‚Äôt think most people would accept that trade off.  Maybe you‚Äôd have leniency after 16 or something.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwqwmsc/)
You seem like you are only focusing on the negative aspects of social media. Wouldn't you say that minors could easily find people who have similar interests to them on social media? It could be a good way for certain minors to make friends, especially if they are considered ""strange"" by their classmates at school.  Also, how can this ban be enforced?|I think the negative outweighs the positive, and to your example I think any real world relationship is infinitely better than one formed online. I‚Äôd much rather my kids have sleepovers than stay up at the computer or on their phones (not that I‚Äôd let a kid under a certain age even have a phone)  Regulated? No idea. But we manage to have laws against the sale of alcohol, tobacco and porn to minors.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwquqwn/)
Social media has issues but it also provides a teenager very good exposure to the world and information about a lot of things. A lot of the general knowledge I have is through the internet, whether it is tv shows or social media. Now teenage years are a huge part of character development and knowing different things can certainly help. Thoughts on this?|TV shows has nothing to do with social media. I‚Äôm not suggesting we ban the internet for kids, just social media. They still get their Netflix, Disney+, maybe even YouTube.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwr06o5/)
One hundred üíØ percent agree how is this even a question|Hey, you coulda been even more confused and thought I meant miners not minors|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwqz2vt/)
It depends on person more than age. Restricting social networking should not happen because children already use it. It is a way to remind everyone they are there. If it is restricted, our children/teens will do worse things. It is not a simple solution. It depends on what they are leaning towards.|I honestly don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd do worse things. A lot of the horror stories you see/read about are kids getting killed or injured doing internet trend challenges they saw on TikTok or wherever.  At least getting them off social media will keep them grounded in the community rather that talking to people all over being exposed to god knows who.  If the community is a risk (which obviously people around you always pose a risk) I don‚Äôt see the logic in widening the pool of people who might pose a risk to your kid from the population of your town to the whole world.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwqxb6f/)
What is your favorite cut of steak|Sirloin probably. I‚Äôm a well done man too.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwqxjjv/)
r/phonesarebad|I don‚Äôt have a problem with phones|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwqzkxs/)
How do you plan on enforcing this?|Pre-install mobile devices with social media blocking software like a security tag on a bottle of alcohol. Prove to the store that you‚Äôre an adult and they remove the software. If you‚Äôre a kid, you get stuck with the software.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwqzswe/)
Of all the social media platforms, in your mind what are the worst?  Top 2 or 3 worst for minors?|Twitter I think is the worst offender just because there‚Äôs no effective moderation on it such that people have been involved in lengthy lawsuits trying to force twitter to remove sexual content of minors and twitter resisted saying they aren‚Äôt responsible for it.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwr025c/)
How about make a law where teenagers can fuck each-other and make it normal so that grooming doesn't happen. For real if laws were based on realistic standards such as the fact it takes 5000 years to evolve and you don't magically change the age at which humans are  to reproduce. Humans are ready to go at 16. So let the teenagers fuck so that sex crimes don't....happen. Bruh. The media ain't the problem it's the laws man.|Uhh what? You seem very keen to be allowed to screw minors dude|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwqys3f/)
If you really care that much just block social media on your Wi-Fi holy fuck it's not that hard.|It‚Äôs not about me on social media it‚Äôs about raising generations of depressed, vulnerable and neurotic people who have 5 minute attention spans and spend family gatherings glued to a screen.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3n9t4/i_dont_think_minors_should_be_allowed_access_to/gwqxwc4/)

Due to appearing ""mild"" *sighs* people don't accommodate or change around me at all, which is nice to not be looked down on, however you could very easily hep me and accommodate me where needed whilst not looking down on me! It feels invalidating and makes me gaslight myself about whether I'm just stupid or mean or wrong in trying times.
On the flipside, I know people get treated poorly and like they're stupid once they disclose it, all I can say is like, have common sense and empathy and...don't?
If I can't verbalise a reply, trust that I understand what I'm being told regardless, if I'm slow to get it, it's because my processing speeds a little lagged, not that the contents too hard etc. This will vary again amongst individuals.
Id say it's most important to not just brush off the info of being told your friend or whoever it is is autistic, and to ask them if there's anything they ever struggle with they may need accommodations or understanding from you with. Mainly understanding. Basically just when they do something like struggle in conflict, stim, go non vocal, argue one logical point and ignore emotions and get stuck on it, have the empathy to respond like, ah, that's due to them being autistic, they're not trying to be rude or mean or lazy or unempathetic, address it, move forward with kindness.

If you want me to do something, give me logical reasoning, it's hard for my brain to change and do all the work for something so I look for fair reason to exhaust myself, and a fair reason for most of us will never be 'because that's the way it is', 'because I said so', 'respect your teachers' etc.
I would always respect my teachers because in general they were lovely people trying their hardest and their care was clear, if I didn't see this effort and respect for me I wouldn't comply with what they asked of me if it was something I didn't want to do already. Understand this is an actual thing, and it's not defiance without cause. I can't be bothered to go into the neurological reasoning for it at the moment but basically our neurones struggle to make new paths and destroy old ones, if you request a new path to be made expect resistance unless you provide adequate reason for that path to be created.
I remember fighting with my family when i went to England at 10 and said I'd refuse to bow to the queen outside of Buckingham palace lol, because also we see everybody the same, in that example i like to use, all of the reasons I should have viewed her as authority were social constructs, I don't understand or care for them. Often I understand the social construct, but I just don't care or agree. Be accepting and expect this, also I'm not the biggest fan of the term special.needs. disability isn't a dirty word, we aren't X men lol, I have no special abilities like time travel and I have no special needs either, rather normal needs, but more of them and more help with regular tasks, nothing special about it at all. As I also work in disability with people with all disabilities they seem to hold the same view from what I've asked and seen so far, obviously this will differ.

Viewing your life as ruined will have a profoundly negative impact on your life.  I urge you to try to change this for your children's sake and equally important, for your sake.   
 To give you a counter to this, I was so affected by my mother's experience, I waited until 44 to be a parent.  I very much wish I had done it much earlier (mind you not in my teens). 

You're going to come across some tough choices.  My advice as a now-grown son of a teenage mother, it will be hard, but all decisions center around the children. What I mean by this is best illustrated in a real-life example:   
My mother had opportunities to make life better for her and us, but the short-term sacrifice was too much for the long-term gain.  She began a degree in accounting in her late 20s with the help of my grandparents.  But balancing a part-time job and school with kids became too much after 2 years.   She went back to working 2 full-time jobs where we were left to raise ourselves.  As a result, by the time my sister was in middle school, she was a drunk staying out till 5 AM most nights eventually dropping out of school.  I often think if my mother had just toughed it out 2 more years, she would have found stable work and been around to help guide and even discipline my sister.  We both suffered emotional development problems (serious anger and resentment issues) which I overcame in my 30s, but my sister still deals with to this day.   


I don't know what choices will be before you, but try to remain principled, and focused. It will be hard and I wish you the best.",,,1620007011,{},gwqhges,False,t3_n3kvdm,False,True,t1_gwqfxpi,/r/AMA/comments/n3kvdm/im_17_and_i_have_two_kids_ama/gwqhges/,1620041279,3,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],,

I'm on the lower end of that scale, but my place of work is one of the highest paying for the state I live in.. if that makes any sense.

**Is it worth the stress?:** For some people? No. Maybe this will change, but right now I find the job to be really rewarding and I think my temperament suits this type of high stress environment. I think I've done a pretty good job of keeping my work life and my personal life separate; it's important not to get too attached to the people in your calls, know when you've done everything that you can, and to not focus on what you ""could've"" done.

**Is there schooling involved?:** I took a two week course that cost less than $1,000.

**If someone says ""I heard gunshots outside""?:** You ask where they're located, preferably an exact address or at the very least a street name if the caller isn't at a set location. We can also see a 9-1-1 callers general location, but exact is best. If you have a partner (another dispatcher in the room), you can tell them to dispatch to that address for the sound of gunshots, or you can tell the caller to hold on while you dispatch over the radio yourself.

Sorry my arabic isn't very good. Just wanted to say a few things: first, I appreciate your opened and vulnerability. I can imagine it's hard to grow under the shadow of such a big wealthy tree.
But you should know that if you and I ever met, I would not judge you for how much money you have, how much you've made and how much you can call your own. It means nothing to me. Making money is mostly a dead end game (zero sum game) In my mind. It's all about what you do with it that can make a big difference in the world. You can save thousands of lives or destroy thousands of lives.and no one would praise you or condemn you for it. It's in your heart, inshallah you will stay true to your heart.

I tend to work on web applications, finding bugs, and there are so many vulnerability's. The most common I have seen is simple misconfigurations that allow a malicious website to send off requests to a website with the users session where he is logged in. This could mean that a hacker could lure you to a website and if you do an action (click on a button or something like that) it could send requests to fetch your user data or change some settings. It's called a CORS misconfiguration!

 **What is the most access you've ever managed to get?** 

I've managed to get root / system access to many machines / servers before, this would give me access to write, read and delete any file on the system. 

 **Have you ever had anyone argue against your findings?** 

Yes, I once found what I believed to be an open redirect vulnerability on facebook (an open redirect is when you can provide a crafted URL from a trusted domain which sends you to another malicious page, it can be used in phising attacks to give the victim a false sense of security, the link would start with [www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com) and redirect to a malicious website. I reported it and they came back with some BS that it was something else and only I would be able to get it to work if not it would send an error message, I explained that Im a bug hunter and it is indeed by definition a open redirect and that I clearly state in my Proof of concept that that was not the case and I explained and proved it not to be the case.

I've read some philosophy that I know are true, and some that I didn't agree with because like I said again some things are obvious but they don't speak to my heart. They speak to my head. I can debate them until I've worn the other person out but it's with my head I reason then out. But when I can believe with my heart, it just become a part of me. 


&gt;I didn't need the bible to know that hurting (or killing) others is bad. Philosophers can come to the same conclusion with no need of religion. (Do you know Kant's Categorical_imperative just as an example?)

Anyone can come to the conclusion with no need of religion. It's called an intuitive knowledge of what's right and wrong.

Romans 2 NIRV:
14 Gentiles do not have the law. Sometimes they just naturally do what the law requires. They are a law for themselves. This is true even though they don‚Äôt have the law. 

15 They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts. The way their minds judge them proves this fact. Sometimes their thoughts find them guilty. At other times their thoughts find them not guilty. 

Gentiles, in Bible lingo are all the nations who aren't Jewish and so weren't bound by the Law given by God through Moses. 

As for the Categorical Imperative, I believe anyone can do the right rational thing if they're being sensible, thoughtful and levelheaded. So it's not as useful to me as I imagine it may be to you. I do see online that it is used as an argument against the Golden Rule (which is found in religions). I honestly didn't know that many religions had the Golden Rule of Do unto others as you would have them do to you. 

So here's what I see on this web link https://www.qcc.cuny.edu/socialsciences/ppecorino/medical_ethics_text/Chapter_2_Ethical_Traditions/Categorical_Imperative.htm in arguments for the Categorical Imperative over the Golden Rule, ¬†

'Why should willingness to be on the receiving end of like action make it permissible? If masochists are willing to suffer others' sadism, would that make sadism right? More generally, can acceptance of being on the receiving end of like action legitimate anything?'

This is a valid question. Only that the Jewish and consequently Christian God has Laws that do not allow for masochism or any sort of evil. His Son, Jesus, referencing the Old Testament law given in Leviticus makes mention of the Golden Rule: 

Even though you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him! In everything, do to others what you would want them to do to you. This is what is written in the Law and in the Prophets.
Matthew 7:11‚Ä≠-‚Ä¨12 NIRV.

But Jesus doesn't stop with giving us that rule. Fulfilling the law, He gives a new commandment that encompasses every other commandment:

‚ÄúI give you a new command. Love one another. You must love one another, just as I have loved you. If you love one another, everyone will know you are my disciples.‚Äù
John 13:34‚Ä≠-‚Ä¨35 NIRV

In the same way, husbands should love their wives. They should love them as they love their own bodies. Any man who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no one ever hated their own body. Instead, they feed and care for their body. And this is what Christ does for the church.
Ephesians 5:28‚Ä≠-‚Ä¨29 NIRV
(To understand these verses, in Christianity a couple is one entity. They're wholly joined before God. That is what the church is to Christ too, His body).

I think it can be argued that a masochist doesn't love themselves. And hasn't let God love them too. So concerning Christianity, the Categorical Imperative v Golden Rule argument is kinda moot. 
 

&gt;You mean that you knew was opposed to the bible or something else? 

James 4:17 NIV says If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn‚Äôt do it, it is sin for them. Here, sin is not only doing wrong but choosing to not do the good you should do. I will use myself as an example. So I went to the kitchen after I'd eaten to drop my plate. No one was eating with me at the time so my plate would be the dirty plate in the sink. I was feeling lazy so I seriously contemplated leaving it for my younger sister to wash whenever she saw it even though I knew that wouldn't be nice of me. After all, I was the one who used the plate. As I was leaving the kitchen, the words, 'If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn‚Äôt do it, it is sin for them' came to mind and I went back to wash the plate. God wouldn't like it if I left the plate there because someone else could wash it. The good thing would be for me to wash it. That's what I mean. 



&gt;That made me smile. You know that ""mistakes"" are when you do something wrong involuntarily, right? If you know its wrong and still do it, it's not a mistake.

You're right. Mistakes are when you do something wrong involuntarily and if you know something is wrong and still do it, it's a willful act. Let's just say I meant I've always known the thing to do and so I've really never had to learn from mistakes. And that when I actually did the wrong thing, they've been willful acts that I justified with curiosity. I don't mean they become okay to do simply because I'm curious. I mean that when my mind is telling me something is wrong to do, if I am curious enough, I would still go ahead to do it. I've quickly learned that it's foolish to do it because the outcome is always the same (me feeling stupid afterwards) so I don't do it. 

On the other hand, I definitely do not agree with the bible's stance on slavery. 

I don't know what stance you're talking about. Maybe you can explain? I do know that in the OT Laws, slaves are protected. 

If a slave comes to you for safety, don‚Äôt hand them over to their master. Let them live among you anywhere they want to. Let them live in any town they choose. Don‚Äôt treat them badly.
Deuteronomy 23:15‚Ä≠-‚Ä¨16 NIRV
https://bible.com/bible/110/deu.23.15-16.NIRV

‚ÄúKeep the Sabbath day holy. Do this just as the Lord your God has commanded you. Do all your work in six days. But the seventh day is a sabbath to honor the Lord your God. Do not do any work on that day. The same command applies to your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, your oxen, your donkeys and your other animals. It also applies to any outsiders who live in your towns. I want your male and female servants to rest, just as you do. Remember that you were slaves in Egypt. The Lord your God reached out his mighty hand and powerful arm and brought you out of there. So the Lord your God has commanded you to keep the Sabbath day holy.

Funnily enough it was not that much of a barrier at all. I simply took an equivalency test in my home country and applied to study medicine in Italy (my mothers home country). The Italian system ranks applicants strictly on performance in an entry exam of logic puzzles and basic sciences. High school results play no role in your application. The only requirement is to have a State authority recognise you as a high school graduate or equivalent for matriculation. 

For about 6 months I studied basic sciences relentlessly. I simply studied straight out of High school Biology, Chemistry and Physics textbooks teaching myself the content and practicing similar questions in MCAT/BMAT question banks. It‚Äôs really unbelievable the difference you can have in your studies when you‚Äôre truly motivated, something I severely lacked throughout HS.

There were approximately 500 Applicants for my university, of which I ranked 6th (the top 50 gaining admission) and the next month I was on a flight back to Italy to start the 6 years of study! 

Thanks very much for the question. The reason I wanted to make this post is to let people know about how many opportunities there are if you look for them.

&gt;Not shocking, but making me even more adamant in not buying into it. Obviously any book that wants to be taken as ultimate, literal truth would state that ""anything against what is written there is false"". That's neither clever nor original. That's how all spammers work too! (And with the Quran there is at least a second book with the same claims and the same big follower-ship backing it up.)

Well, how about the parts where I say if you don't feel any peace with it and if it doesn't resonate with you? Why didn't you tie them in? If something is going to control you, it doesn't want you thinking for yourself or resonating with it and having to feel peace in your heart. It would just want you to do what it says like a mindless machine, regardless of what you're feeling. 


&gt;I really refer back to my original question: What is the reason to put the bible as foundation in the first place? Nothing in the bible can be responsible for it, or I could equally say ""Harry Potter"" is the one true book, because in Harry Potter it states that it is the one and only true book. (It actually doesn't in that book. Still a good read.)

Maybe you have the Bible confused with the Quran. The Bible doesn't say it is the one true book, even though it is to me. God says He is truth (if you think about it, assuming you believe in God, if he does exist and created everything, then He would be truth because we would all get our life from Him). However, when you read the Bible and the words resonate with you, you know it is inspired by Truth (God) because The Holy Spirit who guides us into all Truth will teach it to us. God's Words are His Life and the Bible is His Word recorded to man. Hence, the Bible is Truth. And the Bible doesn't force you to believe it, you either believe it or you don't. The choice is up to you. 

&gt;An yes, I know your answer to this and why you believe it to be true. I'm not even arguing against it, but that doesn't make it true in general. I have read the bible. It does not make me want to believe in it at all. So the bible itself obviously does not hold the ultimate power to make one a believer. So maybe god enlightens people who read the bible to belief? (Like yourself.) Maybe. But not for me. So either God doesn't want me that strongly to belief or the sentiment again is just not worth it. I'm sure God (if existing and interested in that) could make everybody who reads the bible be 'enlightened'. Would be easy. Would not even take away personal choices or such.

It's not God that doesn't want you to believe in Him. You're a skeptic. You won't believe His Word. How would a relationship go between two people when one doesn't trust and is always questioning the other? Nowhere. 

&gt;So the bible itself obviously does not hold the ultimate power to make one a believer.

Nothing and no one holds the power to make one a believer. You believe by yourself. You, a single entity who is responsible for and in control of your life. 

&gt;So either God doesn't want me that strongly to belief or the sentiment again is just not worth it. I'm sure God (if existing and interested in that) could make everybody who reads the bible be 'enlightened'. Would be easy. Would not even take away personal choices or such.

God does not make anyone do anything, even believe. The truth is He wants your love and He wants to be wanted.

Men researching autism only ever did it on white little boys or men, never women or poc etc. I firmly believe if I was male I'd have been diagnosed sooner, as all the diagnosed people around me were male, I only know 2 other female diagnosed officially and I now have many autistic friends of all types. Basically since I was socialised like a girl, and interpreted as one, I learnt how to do all of the social stuff to survive fast.

The God who by inspiration gave words to His prophet and people couldn't explain the human story all at once. He gave inspiration to each messenger in the OT and then Jesus fulfilled them in the NT. 

I think you didn't understand me when I said pick or choose. No one picked and chose the books in the Bible. The OT were written by the prophets of the Jews and the NT by Jesus' disciples. I meant that some Christian denominations pick and choose what they want to believe in the Bible. They alter it to fit their perceptions of God. For example, let's say you were a Christian and you believed in God but you read something in the Bible that you didn't want to accept, you would come up with your own excuses for not accepting it and justify it. Hence, you create your own theory. If you're able to convince others of it and they follow it, it becomes a doctrine that you not only believe but other people believe too. 

I'm not picking on anyone but the Jehovah's Witnesses was started because it's founder couldn't reconcile himself with the fact that God could create a Hell and that Jesus is God. Hence he comes up with a Jesus who is the Great Teacher and not God and a world where there is no Hell. Those aren't truth. That's a lie but he so badly wanted to believe it that he ran with it. And then got others to believe it because they also wanted so badly to believe it. And that's how the Jehovah's Witnesses is born. That is a man's doctrine. Not God's. 

Well, if no citation of a holy text will ever convince you, it's your choice. Only with Christians, the paper and ink and print aren't what's holy. It's the words in the Bible and it's because they're Life and they work on the heart. For example, there was this time someone kinda spoilt my phone charger. It was still functioning but sort of on its last leg and I was getting nervous about it and I was worried it would get totally ruined before I could get a new one. And the words in Philippians 4:6 (be anxious for nothing), seemingly out of nowhere just come up in my heart, literally startling me. I physically froze outwardly like someone was talking to me but those words were in my heart. And it was weird at the time because no one was talking to me. But God did. And it's because I knew the Word. He just brought it to my remembrance. 


&gt;You can't use a thing to prove the very thing itself, that's a circle. It's like answering the question ""Why is something?"" with ""Because it is so!"".

I know I've given you enough answers with spiritual evidence for you to know that I haven't believed on what the Bible says because it is so. I have told you I felt Joy. I have told you I read it for myself. I have told you the Holy Spirit makes it come alive to me and that it is spending time with God. I have told you I have prayed for things and those prayers have been answered. I have given you my reasons. I just haven't given you any of the reasons you want to hear. 

At that time Jesus prayed this prayer: ‚ÄúO Father, Lord of heaven and earth, thank you for hiding these things from those who think themselves wise and clever, and for revealing them to the childlike.  Yes, Father, it pleased you to do it this way!
Matthew 11:25‚Ä≠-‚Ä¨26 NLT

At that time Jesus said, ‚ÄúI praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth [I openly and joyfully acknowledge Your great wisdom], that You have hidden these things [these spiritual truths] from the wise and intelligent and revealed them to infants [to new believers, to those seeking God‚Äôs will and purpose]. Yes, Father, for this way was well-pleasing in Your sight.
Matthew 11:25‚Ä≠-‚Ä¨26 AMP

It reframed my perception of what it meant and so I looked into it further. Previously doctors had diagnosed me with generalised anxiety disorder and OCD, I went to a psychiatrist and got evaluated, I showed up ADHD, BPD likely and autism possible. I then went to a psych another friend recommended who specialises in autism and she said I was definitely autistic in 20 minutes and not BPD and not OCD.

&gt;If you don't feel any peace regarding their message and resonate with it in your heart and (this will be shocking to you) if they say something that's contrary to what is written in the Bible, then pay them no mind. They're definitely not from God. That's the test.

Not shocking, but making me even more adamant in not buying into it. Obviously any book that wants to be taken as ultimate, literal truth would state that ""anything against what is written there is false"". That's neither clever nor original. That's how all spammers work too! (And with the Quran there is at least a second book with the same claims and the same big follower-ship backing it up.)

I really refer back to my original question: What is the reason to put the bible as foundation in the first place? Nothing *in* the bible can be responsible for it, or I could equally say ""Harry Potter"" is the one true book, because in Harry Potter it states that it is the one and only true book. (It actually doesn't in that book. Still a good read.)  
Unless somebody, somehow can proof to me, that a holy book is indeed the one and only true holy book, citing from it is meaningless. (It can still contain human wisdom).   


An yes, I know *your* answer to this and why *you* believe it to be true. I'm not even arguing against it, but that doesn't make it true in general. I have read the bible. It does not make me want to believe in it at all. So the bible itself obviously does not hold the ultimate power to make one a believer. So maybe god enlightens people who read the bible to belief? (Like yourself.) Maybe. But not for me. So either God doesn't want me that strongly to belief or the sentiment again is just not worth it. I'm sure God (if existing and interested in that) could make everybody who reads the bible be 'enlightened'. Would be easy.

You don‚Äôt have to show yourself, not at all, there‚Äôs two ways for a client to reach you and that is through the website and seeing your listing there, or by calling the 1-800 number and selecting you based on your voice and what you may have said during the 15 second recorded greeting. It seems most traffic comes from the website, so if you lack images on your profile it will likely not attract much attention. The images you show on your profile is up to you and can be as classy as you want them to be. Showing a little skin does help, so a bra and pantie pic can do really well, even if you don‚Äôt want to show your face. Secondly, you don‚Äôt even have to use your own pictures. If you‚Äôve purchased content to use, as long as the model is 18 years of age or older, that‚Äôs also okay. There are plenty of people who use fake profiles.

I don‚Äôt know if my company is global however they do extend outside of North America. I know there are plenty of girls on the site from Europe as well, but idk about outside of NA and EU, though I suspect that yes, it is global.

Just look up companies and then research those companies.

* Empathy: Islamic treatment towards women and minorities is disgusting. It is very human to empathize with the sufferings of others which lead me to question certain aspects of Islam.
* Studying Islam: As most of my questions couldn't be answered by society I turned to Islam which made things more confusing for me. The more I studied Islam, the more I grew distant from it as the things taught in the classroom or by our parents are very different from the things in the Quran or Sunnah.
* Internet: I think the most vital role in my journey was played by the internet, talking to people from different backgrounds, gaining knowledge about the other side, studying western, eastern, and modern philosophies, and simply seeing the effects of Islam globally changed me.

This is not even the worst part. Most people accused of blasphemy never make it to the court, they are killed by violent mobs and the killers are often celebrated.

I very conciously do not prey on the weak, as not only do I feel bad for it but the rewards are not great. Instead, I very much ENJOY (gain and game) finding and exploiting the vulnerabilities and needs of people in positions of power or overabundance.

I like working for what I have. But after a few months she started giving me 1,000 a month. And she owned my house so no rent. It wasn't so bad. Then, end of 2019 she told me she was selling the house and no longer helping. THAT is when shit got really tough. Bad credit+low income+no rental history makes it really hard to find an apartment. So, I rented rooms from friends for a year. I struggle with bills, I have to juggle them to keep from losing stuff like my car and storage. That is fucking stressful. But, my son and I just moved into our own place. Its a weekly rental in an rv park but its our own space and we love it. 

As for my view of those things I always had a clear view and perspective. I knew I just got lucky. I always help anyone who needed it I never had wealthy friends all of my friends work their asses off for What Little they have and for all the things my mom didn't teach me how to save money and be a real adult she did teach me how to be kind and compassionate and generous.

---------|----------|----------|
Do you ever wish you weren't born this way?|Sometimes, yes. It's tough navigating a world designed for hearing and there are a ton of people who just don't want to put in even a fraction of the effort I'm putting in to make it accessible. I've learned a lot through adversity and wouldn't trade my experiences for anything. But doesn't mean I don't wish I wasn't deaf. COVID has been maddening as I rely on lip reading and masks have been a huge barrier with that.  Growing up, it was more frequently that I wished I wasn't deaf. But now it's more if something I've learned to get used to and doesn't bother me as much anymore.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2td8l/im_stone_cold_deaf_ama/gwlj0ey/)
Did you learn proper English grammar in high school? I have a good buddy who is deaf and was educated in deaf schools. He said he was behind in college because he didn't learn proper English grammar until he went to college.|English was my first language. I grew up a voracious reader and learned how to speak and write English. I went to regular schools and took a couple of AP English classes. I did not start learning sign language until my last year of high school. I guess you could say I am the opposite of your buddy. My sign language was behind until I really started to pick it up in college. Now I prefer to communicate using sign language.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2td8l/im_stone_cold_deaf_ama/gwltsli/)
You have a great attitude! Is it a genetic condition? If so are any of your family members also deaf?|Thank you for the kind words. I'm still blessed to have what I have today and to be where I am. Being deaf has simultaneously been the most amazing and most frustrating part of my life.  No, it is not genetic. I was born with deformed hair cells in my inner ears. None of my family members or my children are deaf.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2td8l/im_stone_cold_deaf_ama/gwlzs6j/)
When did your parents realize you were deaf?|I was past two years old when I was officially diagnosed with hearing loss. Before that, my parents thought I was just a ""perfect"" baby because I slept through everything. When I got a bit older, my parents started noticing I was not responding to sounds like I should be so they took me to the doctor. They told me they went to three doctors who told them I was fine and to not worry about anything. It was only the fourth doctor who referred them to an audiologist, who then ran some tests and confirmed their suspicions.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2td8l/im_stone_cold_deaf_ama/gwmky4q/)
Do you feel like you are better than average at picking up on body language?|You know the saying that if a person loses or doesn't have one of their five senses, another sense is enhanced. Well I also have horrible eyesight so I didn't get any help in that area either. Thank goodness for prescription eyeglasses and contact lenses.  However, I do feel like my sense of perception is more advanced than my hearing counterparts. Since I don't have noise surrounding me all the time, I rely much more on visual cues, such as body language, to supplement/replace my lack of hearing.  Sometimes I feel like Shawn Spencer from Psych if you've ever watched that TV show. I catch a lot of things most people overlook.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2td8l/im_stone_cold_deaf_ama/gwlqpey/)
Have you watched the movie ‚ÄúA silent Voice‚Äù?|I have not. I'm not too much into anime.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2td8l/im_stone_cold_deaf_ama/gwm28ph/)
do you know sign language?|Yes, I do! While English was my first language growing up, I prefer to use sign language nowadays as my primary form of communication.  I started learning when I was a senior in high school and have been using sign language since.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2td8l/im_stone_cold_deaf_ama/gwm54fi/)
do you hear your own thought?|English was my first language and I learned how to speak and lip read. I don't know if I can define it as ""hearing"" my thoughts, but I think and ""communicate"" with my thoughts in English.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2td8l/im_stone_cold_deaf_ama/gwmriac/)
Do you have any idea what words and letters sound like, or do you just know how to move your mouth to make the letters you want? How did you communicate in order to learn how to speak? I'm very interested in linguistics, but I've never really considered how deaf people who speak interact with spoken language.|I started speech therapy at a very young age, I would guess 4 or 5 years old. I don't exactly remember how it started and how I first learned to form sounds. I was in speech therapy until I was 16 years old. I could never hear enough to distinguish between different sounds, so I focused on mouth movements to form sounds. It's different for each deaf person who learns to speak, but for me the toughest sounds to make are the ""j"" and ""ch"" sounds.  My speech therapists would help me ""feel"" the sounds in my throat. I also picked up a lot on how to pronounce words by watching people speak. I would watch TV with closed captions, read the captions quickly enough that I could then shift over to watch the character actually say the words and I picked up on how they would move their mouths or how some words look like they're pronounced one way, but the actual pronunciation is completely different.  When I use my voice nowadays, I'm pretty careful about my word choice and will sometimes actually plan what I'm going to say in advance so I can avoid tougher to pronounce words and think of easier words or phrases that mean the same thing instead. It can be a lot of work just to have a 2 minute conversation...|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2td8l/im_stone_cold_deaf_ama/gwmrrji/)
Do you believe lack of hearing changes your sense of time|I'm not sure what you mean by this. You mean does time go by slower for me? I don't think so. Sometimes people will comment something took forever, but I thought it went by quickly and vice versa. One thing I do struggle though with is running long distances. Most people will use music or podcasts or something to help pass the time. I don't have that luxury so running a half marathon does feel like forever to me. Other than that, I haven't really noticed a significant difference in perception of time, I guess.  Hope that answered your question.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2td8l/im_stone_cold_deaf_ama/gwmsjki/)
Do you think any of your other senses is way above average?|My other four senses are pretty average or below average. My eyesight is terrible.  However, I do think I have an enhanced sense of perception. Without noise to bother me, I rely more on visual cues and I notice things many people don't. People think Deaf people can't drive, but we are actually probably the safest drivers because we have a stronger sense of perception and pay more attention to the road.  Sometimes I feel like Shawn Spencer from Psych if you've ever watched that. I'm really observant.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n2td8l/im_stone_cold_deaf_ama/gwmzhwh/)

It's different for each deaf person who learns to speak, but for me the toughest sounds to make are the ""j"" and ""ch"" sounds.

My speech therapists would help me ""feel"" the sounds in my throat. I also picked up a lot on how to pronounce words by watching people speak. I would watch TV with closed captions, read the captions quickly enough that I could then shift over to watch the character actually say the words and I picked up on how they would move their mouths or how some words look like they're pronounced one way, but the actual pronunciation is completely different.

When I use my voice nowadays, I'm pretty careful about my word choice and will sometimes actually plan what I'm going to say in advance so I can avoid tougher to pronounce words and think of easier words or phrases that mean the same thing instead.

I do think the great replacement is probably true.
3. I used to have a political group just for iranian nazis, and i am in alot of national socialist telegram groups, i do look up to people such as tom sewell, martinez perspective, aryan bacon and others
4. I don't have that much really, i dont argue with people online since its a waste of time and achieves no purpose. The only difficulty i would have is probably is trying to explain something in real life, since i cant tell them to search up a certain thing.

[],,Sefay7,,,[],,,,text,t2_a4ix8kos,False,False,[],"Hello. It's the person with the I'm a Christian, AMA again. It has been on my mind to write you again. I sense that my answer wasn't satisfactory enough. Like I didn't explain things well enough to you. So I'd like to be able to do that again, if it's okay. So here goes:

I will explain why there's a Hell in the first place. God has always existed before He ever created the world we're in now. There was and still is the spiritual world with God and angelic beings. Satan (the devil) was one of them until he decided to rebel against God. God tells Ezekiel this (and us too) in Ezekiel 28:12 - 19(NLT) : 

12 ‚ÄúSon of man, sing this funeral song for the king of Tyre. Give him this message from the Sovereign Lord : ‚ÄúYou were the model of perfection, full of wisdom and exquisite in beauty. 

13 You were in Eden, the garden of God. Your clothing was adorned with every precious stone ‚Äî red carnelian, pale-green peridot, white moonstone, blue-green beryl, onyx, green jasper, blue lapis lazuli, turquoise, and emerald‚Äî all beautifully crafted for you and set in the finest gold. They were given to you on the day you were created.

14 I ordained and anointed you as the mighty angelic guardian. You had access to the holy mountain of God and walked among the stones of fire.

15 ‚ÄúYou were blameless in all you did from the day you were created until the day evil was found in you.

16 Your rich commerce led you to violence, and you sinned. So I banished you in disgrace from the mountain of God. I expelled you, O mighty guardian, from your place among the stones of fire.

17 Your heart was filled with pride because of all your beauty. Your wisdom was corrupted by your love of splendor. So I threw you to the ground and exposed you to the curious gaze of kings.

18 You defiled your sanctuaries with your many sins and your dishonest trade. So I brought fire out from within you, and it consumed you. I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the sight of all who were watching. 

19 All who knew you are appalled at your fate. You have come to a terrible end, and you will exist no more.‚Äù


In Isaiah 14(NLT), there's also mention of the devil's fall in verses 12 to 17: 

12 ‚ÄúHow you are fallen from heaven, O shining star, son of the morning! You have been thrown down to the earth, you who destroyed the nations of the world. 

13 For you said to yourself, ‚ÄòI will ascend to heaven and set my throne above God‚Äôs stars. I will preside on the mountain of the gods far away in the north. 

14 I will climb to the highest heavens and be like the Most High.‚Äô 

15 Instead, you will be brought down to the place of the dead, down to its lowest depths. 


These verses show you that Satan was one of the angels of God, blameless until he was consumed with pride and as a result, committed evil. He decided that he wanted to be God, forgetting that the created can never be greater than the Creator and got punished for it. The punishment was he got sent to Hell. So Hell wasn't created for humans. It is important that you know and understand that. It's also important you understand that Satan is the originator and father of evil. There was no such thing as evil until it was found in him. 

Now, as I've told you before, the devil knows he's condemned to Hell and since he's spiteful (you know, being evil), he decides again to bring humans (God's loved creation) under condemnation and judgement. He does this by deceiving Adam and Eve, getting them to eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, thereby bringing sin and evil into the world (you'll see this in the book of Genesis). He (Satan) also gets the authority over the earth given by God to Adam through his deception. So he begins to influence men's thoughts and actions, tempting them to commit evil. Conversely, even as Satan tempts men to commit evil, he also accuses them before God and in their hearts also. The devil is the accuser of the brethren:

Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: ‚ÄúNow have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Messiah. For the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down.
Revelation 12:10 NIV


To explain how Satan does this in the lives of Christians, I am including a quote from this weblink, https://www.ficm.org.uk/node/528:

Satan often uses temptation and accusation as a brutal one-two punch. He comes along and says, ""Why don't you try it? Everybody does it. Besides, you can get away with it. Who's going to know?"" Then as soon as we fall for his tempting line, he changes his tune to accusation: ""What kind of a Christian are you to do such a thing? You're a pitiful excuse for a child of God. You'll never get away with it. You might as well give up because God has already given up on you.""

But enough about that, we humans also have a conscience and when we do wrong, we know it. And since God is good and just and righteous, and demands righteousness from us, humans are under judgement to Hell. 


Romans 3:10-14:

10 As it is written: ‚ÄúThere is no one righteous, not even one;  

11 there is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God.  

12 All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one.‚Äù  

13 ‚ÄúTheir throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe poison of vipers is on their lips.‚Äù  

14 ‚ÄúTheir mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.‚Äù  ruin and misery mark their ways,  and the way of peace they do not know.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThere is no fear of God before their eyes.‚Äù

There's no perfect human who hasn't lied or done bad things so it's correct to say we're all under that judgement. When a sin is committed, someome has to pay for that sin. In the Old Testament, with God and the Jews, whenever they committed a sin, they had to confess it before the Levitical priest and bring an animal sacrifice. Their sins would be transferred to and paid for by that animal until they committed another sin and had to bring another sacrifice because the blood of animals is not enough to purify a man.

God knew that and so He sent His Son, Jesus, fully God and man, perfect and blameless into the world so that He could pay for our sins. John 1:29 NIV - The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, ‚ÄúLook, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!

John 3:

16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 

17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 

The crucifixion of Jesus was His sacrifice: God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
2 Corinthians 5:21 NIV

Romans 3 NIV:
23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 

24 and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood‚Äîto be received by faith. 

25 He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished‚Äî 

26 he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.

All men are condemned to be punished as a result of sin to Hell and the only thing that can redeem them from that punishment is belief in Jesus Christ. Belief in Jesus justifies us and we become the righteousness of God. We no longer have to worry about being bad or good. We just think like God thinks and do as He would do, something the Holy Spirit helps us out with that. And in our spirit there is love and joy and peace and every good thing you can think of given to us a as a gift from God:

But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.
Galatians 5:22‚Ä≠-‚Ä¨26 NIV

I can't tell you what the best solution is, but I'd recommend you to change something. And don't hesitate to ask for help, this can also be professional help. Drug and also psychological issues are something that is hard to deal alone with.

Let me tell you something. A few years ago, in the end of my 20's, I was really stuck as well. I did not have any drug issues and I think it's not completly comparable. After several rejection from women I liked I thought, nobody will ever love me. I was studying, but it was a burden and no fun anymore. I had to fight to get out of bed in the morning. I was depressed.

Luckily I got out of there alone, but I know, that this is not a matter of course. I was lucky and I should have asked for help.

There was a moment, where I thought about, what I would like to do right now. I always wanted to travel the world. But when I was younger, I had no money. Now I was stuck in studies and my student job, with also not enough money. I had no time for that. So, I decided to quit my master. I asked my employer, to start full time. They accepted and from this moment on, I felt already much better. I had made a change, and had a new objectiv: Travel to Australia. I saved money for one year and went there. At the first days in a hostel, I met a travelling woman. Today she is my wife, and I have a happy life.

What I'm trying to say is, you are young and it is never to late to change something. Even if you think, you have a shitty life right now, better times will come. Don't give in. It will get better.

Honestly, I wish you all the best!",,,1619942484,{},gwmx2lx,False,t3_n2zu2g,False,True,t1_gwmn271,/r/AMA/comments/n2zu2g/im_a_total_fucking_loser_ama/gwmx2lx/,1619968010,2,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],,

[],,TheAmmiSquad,,,[],,,,text,t2_9pe5ixu,False,False,[],"Fair question! Prefacing: I am not an expert on scripture or Islam as a religion, merely a learner and a follower. I do recognize that the stories related in the Quran are not monolithically interpreted, but reflect the sociological, sectarian and academic context of the interpreter. 

The cited example of Sodom and Gomorrah talks about a number of sins including male homosexuality, pervasive indiscriminate adultery,  non-consensual sodomy of guests and travelers, looting and robbing, various other violations of the rights of guests but also critically refusing to believe in one God and not listening to the teachings of the Prophet Lut. These acts are also not spoken off as isolated transgressions so much as a pervasive part of the culture and the way of living for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. Was men laying with other men the tipping point when God decided to destroy them? That inference, I think is more a function of the politics and culture of the purveyors of Islam, especially when they became more Wahabbi in the last couple or centuries. 

Only Allah knows the absolute truth but I also can't deny that most Islamic jurisprudence does condemn homosexuality as a sin. This debate itself has led to a lot of internal turmoil. Am I unquestionably gay? I have come to realize that I am. Am I then an abomination and does God deem my mere existence and identity a punishable offence? This I pursue differently from the law, as I do believe far more in the mercy, kindness and acceptance of Allah than of the people who interpret and enforce Islamic law.

I thought I was gay when I was maybe 13-14 and actively hated myself for it and tried to suppress it. I always attributed it to my sexual abuse as a child and how that perhaps made me a sexual deviant. It led to suicidal thoughts and multiple suicide attempts exacerbated by the BPD. It has taken a lot of praying but I do believe that I am OK with who I am now. At a personal level, I also believe that Allah accepts me for who I am. 

Not sure if both of these aspects of my identity CAN co-exist but they ARE co-existing. I am gay (something I know to be objectively true) and I am muslim (I believe, I pray and I give charity in the name of Allah). The choice to deny or accept that truth is your right, but I hope in your heart, you also recognize that there is a Higher Power far better positioned to judge me fairly than you or our fellow human beings.",,,1619939612,{},gwmu05p,True,t3_n2dwji,False,True,t1_gwlqtni,/r/AMA/comments/n2dwji/gay_muslim_man_in_his_mid30s_csa_survivor_and_bpd/gwmu05p/,1619966168,1,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],,

Long answer: after college, I was in massive student loan debt and went nuts paying them off because I couldn‚Äôt stand being in debt (my folks were lower middle class and always living paycheck to paycheck). So I worked for a year and a half, while taking 80-90% of every paycheck and paying down my student loans until I paid them off. After I did, I felt like I‚Äôd lost part of my life working a job that I hated just trying to get out of debt. So I wanted to get out and live doing something I always wanted too (see the world). So in 2016, I backpacked 3000 miles throughout the US and caught the travel bug. My friend suggested I get a van to upgrade my travel style. So I spent another year and half converting it and now I‚Äôm working on hitting up all 50 states! üòÑ

And on top of that, her name was Jennifer, but she went by Jenny, (only to other staff, of course) which only made her that much cuter to me. I've never seen an ugly Jennifer.

3) I would buy a lot of video game stuff that I've always wanted. A few pinball tables for sure. A NICE comfortable gaming chair. I'd get some models that I've always wanted, too. A big Enterprise-D replica from Star Trek: The Next Generation. That's all I can think of rn. Lol.

For a full tank currently, I believe it‚Äôs like $80. If I‚Äôm driving a decent amount. That‚Äôll last me about a week.

But I typically find a place to park for more than one day (usually 4-5) so I can work.

But using the average of moving a lot (this is more like driving around for fun to national parks and stuff)

$320 gas/month

More realistic (not constantly moving every day)

$160 gas/month

I have a fridge, so I rarely eat out. I can get by on around $30 bucks a week.

But sometimes you crave a big burger üçî

So high end (eating out a few times a week $60/week - $240 food/month)

Low end $30/week - $120 food/month

Bills

Vehicle Insurance I pay once a year $780 rather than month to month

Phone/internet $130/month this is high because I have unlimited data and a mobile WiFi. Need it for working (I work remotely)

So ballpark high end $690/month

Low end $410 a month
