1. Fair enough. I just wanted to know if u are a quranist or not. 

2. I feel like u contradicted your own words here.. According to an authentic hadith (https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5134) aisha was 6 when she married and 9 when muhammad had sex with her. As for ur second bit.. Islam is a book for all times to come. Sure child marriages were common back then but so was slavery (which islam allows) but with time we learned that slavery and child marriages are wrong. Just because something used to be a norm doesn't mean it was okay.. And islam is not just a book for its time.. But for all times to come. Surely u can understand how problematic that is? After 6 years of having discussions with muslim preachers.. They told me he married her at 6 but only had sex with her when she was 9 because thats when she hit puberty.. And my response is.. Firstly u will need to prove me that she hit puberty at that age, secondly even if thats true.. Pedophilia isnt just having sex with minors.. Its also having a relationship with them.. Which muhanmad did by marrying her at 6. The fact he waited three years to have sex with her shows that she definitely didnt even reach puberty when she got married.

3. Here is the hadith (https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130) so seems like aisha didnt even hit puberty when she went to live with muhammad at 9 as she played with her friends and her dolls which according to this hadith is forbidden but since she was a kid it was allowed for her.

4. I guess I would ask what constitutes danger to Islam or muslims? And can u back that up with an authentic islamic source? The sources ive read clearly say apostates and blasphemers should be put to death. I may be wrong in that case i apologize however i havent read anything to suggest that. Are you familiar with the hadith where this slave woman (or master? Not sure) said something bad abt muhammad to her master/slave so he killed her and when muhammad was abt to put him to death he told him he killed her because she said something bad about muhammad so muhammad said what he did was right and he wasnt given the penalty anymore?
As for adultery.. I would say that is still extremely harsh. Sure adulterous are assholes but to put them to death is insanee and very much the opposite of peace.

5. That is factually untrue. Lots of nations are doing very well with female leaders. New Zealand for example. It became the first country to get rid of covid by installing strict measures... Even countries with lower population and a male leader have not been able to do what NZ did. Uk is one of the most powerful country in the world. And its ruled by the Queen. Women being emotional is mostly a factor of social norms of our society. There are many strong and powerful women out there who don't let emotions affect their leadership skills. Surprisingly we see a lot of male leaders nowdays being too emotional

6. I do think that is silly. Why have that for women and not for men? Why sexualize women so much that they need to be soo protected and covered when men don't have to? I apologize but what u said was very sexist. Women without hijab is like leaving them open to danger? Also evidence shows that rape isnt about lust.. Its about power.. Men who rape dont care what u dress like.. A woman can be all covered up and they would still rape if they are rapists. This is something that has been backed up by evidence. Also, how u set the social norms of your environment determines the sexualizing factor.. When u r living in a place where women are soo sexualized that even showing hair is forbidden because it might tempt men, then u know u need to fix your country. Perfect example is this; in america a woman wearing short sleeves shirt and long baggy pants is considered modest and thats what even christians there want the extend of women to show their skin.. No one finds it ""sexual"" there to see a woman like that.. But if she did the same in a muslim country, she would be considered as a sexual object because that kind of dressing isnt modest enough in that environment.. However, in america,  a woman wearing a very small bikini and underwear is something thats sexualized and deemed ""bad"" in america so if a woman does that there, people see it as a sexual thing.. So its all about how you set the social norms of your place.. I can also point at africa.. There are some countries in Africa where its normal for women to have their breasts out in public and no one sees it as a sexual thing.. Why? Cos its a social norm there.. Do u know before 1936 men in usa couldn't show off their nipples in public? Because it was deemed sexual.. A movie that showed men shirtless was considered controversial.. But social norms changed.. And now men being shirtless is not a big deal at all.

I apologize for such a long reply. Thank you for your time.",,,1619303627,{},gvra8yn,False,t3_mxi5at,False,True,t1_gvr3kyl,/r/AMA/comments/mxi5at/im_a_muslim_with_pretty_good_knowledge_of_my/gvra8yn/,1619320056,1,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],

3. I was raised in a very conservative, small minded, racist house. When I joined the military that was the first time I was really around anybody different than me. I have been reevaluating my biases ever since.

if i had to say, it's not that i wanted to stop, because it helped me feel alive.

but i was hurting the people i loved. it wasn't just me. my mom, my friends, my sister, my ex at the time. every time i relapsed and came to them and they saw my wrists or my thighs or my arms or whatever, they would have the saddest look on their face. they never blamed me, but i couldn't keep seeing that sadness in their eyes. i realized i had to stop before it went too far and i couldn't ever keep my loved ones happy.

i have an app called ""I Am Sober"" (for all sorts of addictions) where you can log your feelings, how many days you've been clean, talk with other people who are in the same milestone ballpark as you, and a bunch of other stuff. it's helped a lot.

alongside making music, drawing art, going out and enjoying time with my sister, having virtual dates with my partner who lives 400+ miles away during a pandemic. it's the little things that remind me why i'm staying alive and staying clean.

it's so hard to recover but i truly believe in my heart everyone has at least one reason. they just have to find it, and i believe they'll also do that at the right time.",,,1619300335,{},gvr3yav,True,t3_mxso5e,False,True,t1_gvr2g2e,/r/AMA/comments/mxso5e/i_attempted_suicide_7_times_during_my_teen_years/gvr3yav/,1619316671,1,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],

1. Do I believe in hadiths?
Yes, they are the 2nd source of shari'a after quran and a muslim who doesn't believe in them is basically neglecting a big part of his religion.

2. Aisha was 6 and Islam allows pedophilia.
No that's not true at all. There's no solid proof of her age when she got married, and even if she was, you have to consider the traditions and norms at that place and time (adulthood was defined as when someone hit puberty back then), and Islam does not allow pedophilia in any way, shape or form.

3. She was playing with her dolls which is forbidden.
There's nothing that forbids playing with dolls, if you meant something else please let me know.

4. Adulterous, blasphemers, and apostates are to be put to death.
Blasphemers and apostates are only put to death if they're dangerous to Islam and muslims, and are free to live their lives within an Islamic community otherwise.

Now those who commit adultery are to face different penalties depending on a number of things. First, if an unmarried (virgin) man commits adultery with an unmarried (virgin) woman, their penalty is a hundred lashes each and banishment for a year. And if a married (or had been married previously) man commits adultery with a married (or had been previously married) woman, their penalty is stoning to death.

5. No nation could succeed with a woman leader.
I believe that could be true to some extent, women get emotional sometimes and that might affect the decisions taken if the full lead was in a woman's hand. Although that doesn't stop a woman from being a leader today as most of the decisions are taken in some sort of parliament which has male and female members

6. How I feel about hijab.
If you have an expensive gem, you'd want to hide it from everyone and keep it safe. That's exactly what hijab is.

This has disadvantages, too, however.  I saw an employee break a finger through their own fault, and they got put on extremely light duty for four months at UPS.  I've broken fingers playing sports and I returned in two weeks.


Also, remember that unions take a large chunk of money anyways.  I got paid more monthly at Amazon working for $16/hr compared to UPS paying $19/hr.  Considering the qualifications for working at Amazon, I think $16/hr starting pay is ridiculously generous.


I am in favor of unions for people that work full-time, but the majority of UPS and Amazon employees in the warehouse are part-time.  I don't want to see such a hefty union due if employees aren't even getting paid $50 a day because there simply isn't enough work to have them there more than two hours.

About a year ago, I was driving to visit my wife at the hospital one more time before she went to bed. I had been delayed and visiting hours were shorter due to COVID and I was in danger of missing the window entirely. I was speeding, driving over a bridge, downtown.  The gigantic police officer who pulled me over asked me where I was headed and I blurted out ""Sorry Officer, I'm going to visit my wife in palliative care at the hospital before visiting hours end.""

He took ID back to his car, came back about 2 min later and said ""I'm just going to give you a warning tonight. That rate of speed was dangerous. I'm sure your wife wouldn't want to get a ticket or worse, be in an accident. Take care.""

I think about that Police Officer's kindness a lot and ever since that day - I do not speed out of respect for him. Had I gotten the ticket, I'm sure I'd rationalize that I 'paid my debt' to society.

Of course, I just sulfured the migraine , and couldn't do much to mitigate same. My work nature was such , that I couldn't give myself any rest, nor did I know  any way to mitigate same. 

However, your eye twitching  is a pre-signal of the migraine. You should stop all activities if possible, sit calmly in a place and close your eyes. A darker place would be better or you can wear your eye band. Take some deep breathe and calm yourself down. This may take some 20 to 30 minutes for you to feel having regained your composure. Slowly come out of the process avoiding very bright light and giving your eyes to adjust again to the normal lighting condition.

Be aware also, This is nearly done on spot and at times you would have no option than to  carry your anti-migraine tablet and take it on getting the pre-signal or when the pain is already there or has become severe.

Migraine, actually indicates you need to pay attention to something related to your lifestyle, which the body is signaling to you. It may be overworking, overthinking or some habits not appropriate for you. I hope this help. If you have any specific further question , do let me know. Wishing you all the best.

For example, let's take the time I worked at UPS as a package loader (union).  Oftentimes the starting pay would be around $19.00 an hour.


Most employees get around 90 minutes of work each day, so we'll round up and say each employee is getting 8 hours a week, which means $152 a week.  Each week they would take off my hourly wage multiplied by 1.33 (I believe it was), so I'm getting paid closer to $125 a week.  The first paycheck of each month also takes off $50 for union dues, meaning that I'm losing about $75 of my paycheck because of union dues.


That is my main reason as a worker.  I was a part time supervisor at UPS, and during that time I saw that unions also protect employees that should've been let go a long time ago.  The most annoying one (and the reason I quit) was when a guy grabbed a woman's ass with a wide hand and squeezed it, and he was back within two weeks.

I think that two things can be true at once. There has undoubtedly been a massive increase in people identifying as trans within the past few years, but it honestly makes sense because of the increase of awareness and acceptance that's been going on. If I was born 10 years earlier, I probably would have either came out a lot later or committed suicide. 

However, when something becomes a hot topic, people like to jump on the bandwagon. I do think that some people, especially young girls, have confused other issues for gender dysphoria. Proper psychological examinations before making any medical decisions is important imo. I don't know if I think that *most* people are confused/faking it, but I think there are probably a large number of people that have got a bit muddled up and will hopefully figure themselves out later. 

Detransitioning (after starting medical transition) really isn't common in my country though. If you take the NHS route, you sit on a waiting list for years and go through psychological examinations before being given hormones/approved for surgeries. I was diagnosed with Transsexualism (ICD10 F64.0) before I was given testosterone (it's called gender incongruence in the newest version of the ICD I think).

An officer needed to take pictures of bruising for evidence on a charge I had filed, and he refused me an escort, refused me a female police officer, and refused me an additional officer to make me feel safe, so I decided not to allow the pictures and charges were dropped. The bruising was on my breasts. As a result, 4 days later, the police were called to force me to go home, because child abuse was unfounded. It was 2 new officers on the scene, and I tried to explain what had happened and volunteer for the pictures then, but they refused to listen to me. Instead, I did juvenile detention time for assaulting my stepmother, from when I punched her back in self-defense.

At 16, I was arrested again for shoplifting (one-time thing - I was a troubled kid but I’m better now), and I was interrogated by a female police officer, who told me she’d worked for my city for 10 years.
