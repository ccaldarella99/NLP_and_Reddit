Well, I once was engaged to a hot latino type chick I met at College. We hit it off so good, did a ton of partying and the sex was amazing!

After dating her a while, I could tell there was something strange about her family. She claimed that she didn’t know what part of the world her ancestors were from, didn’t know where her last name came from, her parents had blonde hair and blue eyes, but had Latino accents. I later found out their first language was Portuguese and they were from Brazil.

Anyway, about a year later I asked her father for her hand in marriage, he sat down with me and explained that his parents were avid Nazis who fled to Brazil just before the war ended. 

He obviously didn’t like for people to know this, and had a hard time finding a way to tell me. I didn’t really care. I told him that I loved her for who she was and it didn’t matter who her grandparents were, all that mattered was who she was.

Anyway, it seemed important for her that I meet her relatives in Brazil, and apparently, her parents went there to visit every few years. So we planned the most bizarre trip of my life. When you first arrive, nothing seems off about the colony. They speak Portuguese and German, they have jobs, they drive cars, they don’t stand out in any way except that they look different than other Brazilians. The colony is isolated, and the few locals who are around don’t seem to care of really quite grasp what’s going on. But once you start talking to people, you realize that they are deeply disturbed and have a deep-seated hatred for anyone who is different from them, especially Jews. I remember one conversation I had with her great uncle, a man who, I kid you not, had a Hitler mustache. ‘If you are going to be a part of this family you have to understand what we are planning. This is not some sad, little nursing home for the Nazi way of life to die, it is merely an incubator.’”

We broke off the engagement when I told her that my uncle had married a Jewish girl in the 1970s....

I have a Shark IQ with auto-empty. The little guy has been cleaning around 1500 sq ft *daily* for the past 520 days like a champ. Doesnt get stuck on vent covers or between chair legs. Hasn't fallen down any stairs.

It uses camera based navigation that isn't as accurate as laser mapping, but its not too bad. I'd say it might miss a small area once every 4-5 runs. The newer revision has added a second camera that apparently helps. It has never failed to return to its dock to recharge or resume from where it left off afterwards.

Auto-empty is the best thing ever. After every run it empties itself into a large bin attached to the charging dock. I empty the bin every 2 months or so.

As far as student loans being a positive for building credit, I mean, yes, that's a thing. But there are definitely others ways to do that. Starter credit cards, small personal loan, then maybe a small-is car loan. The credit system is flawed, but big student loans aren't the solution.

My biggest issue with what you're saying is ""unable to pay off their debt if they chose a reasonable degree"" It's not just about being unable to pay the debt off, although that's certainly an issue. It's bigger than that. It's the pressure that such a large costs adds.

We need a well educated population in may areas. We need artists, scientists, social workers , teachers, doctors, museum curators, civil engineers. And tons of other jobs. With college being so expensive, it's hard to justify going to school for 5+ years to get a masters in social work if you'll make 40K a year. It's hard to justify going for an education degree if you'll start at 32K a year (which was my experience in Arizona). But we need those people. We need museum curators, but if you're taking out a loan for that program, it's hard to justify going into a lower paying field, even if on a society level, we need those position.

“Your dog misses you, why don’t you visit”

After I got broken up with and needed a shoulder she said “you’ll get over it” with 0% sympathy. 

“I gave you the gift of life” Wow, I really wish you hadn’t, because living in apartments and trailers while still barely scrapping by isn’t what I would call a good life. 

While I was still unemployed and in high school she would occasionally some into my room when I was trying to sleep and go on and on and on about grandkids, despite the fact that I barely talked to girls because of a recent break up. On top of accusing me of sleeping with a girl in my room when I was 16 when we were only cuddling under my blanket. I didn’t lose my virginity till I was 21. 

Occasionally I’d write suicide notes to get all my feelings out, to see who I’d effect and just to get all the negativity out, and usually threw the notes away once everything subsided. There was one time I forgot and she found it what she said hurt, a lot. “I can’t afford a funeral” in a matter of fact, only thinking about the money kind of tone. 

“You’ll always stay with me right?” 

When I opened up to her about my sexuality and being Bi, she said “it’s just a phase”. I said the same thing to my brother a few years later and he said “cool, want another beer?”

I had a friend, who looked a lot like my older brother when he was around that age. She absolutely hated him, anytime he was around she’d be the most toxic person I’ve ever met. Granted the kid was a loudmouth, and could come across as a bully in the wrong light, he was a good kid. I didn’t realize this until I was an adult. 

In her defense, she’s definitely the black sheep of the family and she was abused from a young age. However you shouldn’t put all of your problems onto your kids, or recite the same stories of abuse to them over and over again until they question the validity when small details change. Being a single mom and working fast food is rough, I get it.

I have issues with her and will never call her mom again, because other female figures in my life have earned that title more than she has in my eyes.

Chuck, Tito, Rich Franklin, Bas Rutten, Mark Coleman, a lot of mid-level guys, a few refs and ring card girls.  If you hang around the strip during a fight weekend, you're bound to run into a few fighters.  I've gone to a few of the expos as well.  Of the more memorable ones--Matt Hughes was great because he was my favorite fighter when I was really into UFC, and despite what I had heard secondhand, he was really cool and appreciative.  Cowboy Cerrone was also very friendly and much bigger in person.  Razor Rob McCollough and Max Holloway were both very gracious and happy to be recognized.  A friend of mine spotted Edith Labelle a few years removed from UFC and she was really happy to be remembered as well.  Across the board everyone I've met from MMA was nice.  Phil Davis had kind of an awkward interaction with my brother, but I had met him once before that and he was totally cool, so that may have been my brother's fault.

For wrestlers, it's mostly late 90s ECW guys, as I went to a lot of the shows back then.  Tommy Dreamer spent like an hour with fans, talking and posing for pictures even though we caught him as he was leaving.  I actually felt guilty for spotting him because after he briefly chatted with my group, he probably felt like he had to do the same with everyone, and he had had a rough match that night and looked like he just wanted to crawl into bed.  At one show, I remember New Jack briefly signing a few autographs and then as he was leaving, some little girl called out, ""New Jack, I love you!"" and I swear to God he turned around and said, ""I love you too!"" and ran back and picked her up and gave her a Disney spinning hug.  

I also went to a lot of ROH shows in the mid 2000s in NYC at Basketball City and later the Manhattan Center, so I've met a few of those guys, but mostly just briefly.  I do remember once while we were in line outside, KENTA came out and just walked around talking to people on line.  I think it was one of his first shows there.  Another time Julius Smokes got off the bus, a regular MTA bus, in front of the arena and immediately went into his ""Yeah yeah yeah!"" shtick, but then I briefly spoke to him later in the show and he was shockingly normal.  I took my girlfriend at the time to one show and we saw Jim Cornette on the way to concessions, and I said, ""Mr. Cornette, how are ya, sir?"" and he fired back, ""How you doin, buddy?"" and my gf asked if he was my neighbor.

Watched the Office, didn't laugh once. Watched TBBT and Friends and laughed a few times.

I absolutely abhor democracy of any kind on the principle that that the majority of people can't make good decisions for themselves, let alone for the collective.

Think that there more bad people in the world than good ones.

Find Cardi B music, Tiktok and many other things reddit hates that don't really hurt anybody to be okay or at least nothing to be upset about or bothered by.

Don't hate Michael Bay movies.

Think the vast majority of redditors don't know a lot of people and have a very limited understanding of the human experience, often labeling people into simple classes that don't correlate with the real world.

Don't give a shit about character development, plot consistency, logic or realism in movies, bad cgi or anything like that. As long as I laugh or I don't wanna look at my phone, I find the movie or series to be good.

""You will never understand me.""

I was an introverted kid when growing up, I was socially akward aswell and I didn't know how to have a normal conversation with other kids. I was getting bullied alot for it and learned that if I keep things to myself, less harm will come my way.

Thanks to the years of drama club and some amazing people I met there, I changed from an introvert to a person who can start up conversations with strangers with ease. But it didn't change the way of how I bottle things inside me.

To mom I always seem like I don't care about anything and that I'm always calm in hard situations ""like an alien"".

It started pissing me off when I knew very well that it's not like that, but whenever I stand up for myself, she looks shocked and starts getting more angry at me for talking back. It's like if I'm not acting as I did when I was 12 (shy, quiet, doesn't talk and doesn't get involved), she thinks I'm a completely different person, out of this world. 

I think I got a bit off amd ranted a bit, sorry for that. 
In conclusion:

Don't push your kid away from you when you're having a hard time, they care for you and always want to help, by saying they'll never understand, you're not helping them or yourself.",,,1619303971,{},gvrawff,False,t3_mxf4dl,False,True,t3_mxf4dl,/r/AskReddit/comments/mxf4dl/what_is_the_most_toxic_thing_a_parent_can_say_to/gvrawff/,1619320414,1,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

when exactly? also, you kind of are to the point where its frightening. i just came here to tell you how to be more persuasive to people who aren't vegans and your hostility is basically leaking off the page.



""First can I ascertain, are you vegan? Just want to clarify""
assume I only eat meat. or assume i am vegan. would that change how you approach the conversation? would i get labeled as a demon or an ally in your mind?



""The whole ‘baby murderer’ thing isn’t an apt description because most people don’t view a foetus as a baby""
plenty of people do. and many people don't feel animals have the same rights as humans. you should know that by now given your online experience. i am telling you how to work around that difference to help make those values more normalized. 




""I didn’t ask for your advice, I’m not trying to sell you something""
if that's the case, what is it that you do online 99% of the time? pick fights and troll with no end goal? 



""most people have basic values not to rape/torture/abuse/murder others for no good reason""
basic values against their own kind. murdering animals that are traditionally eaten as food? there is no basic universal value shared for this. i'm not going to drive over to my friends farm and preach to him and his family to not eat animal/animal products. unless its something universal, there is no guarantee people will grow up with the same values or develop the same values. 




"" the vegan that’s actually turned the most people vegan (Gary Yourofsky) is abrasive as fuck so what you’re saying is not actually rooted in reality.""

because people shared the same values with respect to animals. either that, or they lacked exposure into food manufacturing completely. most of the people you talk (argue) with do not hold your values, they are also aware of how products are made by now. you won't get much farther by preaching unshared values; did you actually convince anyone?",,,1619303962,{},gvravt2,False,t3_mvc7ra,False,False,t1_gvr4i6n,/r/AskReddit/comments/mvc7ra/what_was_a_disturbing_sign_that_your_friend_might/gvravt2/,1619320404,1,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

Monster has always been known for selling $5 cables for $100, and they were frequently lower quality than the $5 cables.

She came into my room on my birthday, I was grounded for taking food when they didn’t give it to me. They never gave me food, I always scrounged for it due to me being the literal term, a bastard. My half brother was able to have some, but I was not. She came to my room and stated she wish she wouldn’t have listened to everyone and had gotten the abortion. This was in 2002.

Christopher Brown and Robyn F. (Rihanna) have been involved in a dating relationship for approx one and half years. On Sunday, February 8, 2009 at 0025 hours, Brown was driving a vehicle with Robyn F. as the front passenger on an unknown street in Los Angeles. Robin F. picked up Brown’s cellular telephone and observed a three page text message from a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with. A verbal argument ensued and Brown pulled the vehicle over on an unknown street, reached over Robyn F. with his right hand, opened the car door and attempted to force her out. Brown was unable to force Robyn F. out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit he took his right hand and shoved her head against the passenger window of the vehicle causing an approximate one inch raised circular contusion. Robyn F. turned to face Brown and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand. He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F’s mouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle.

Brown looked at Robyn F. and stated, “I am going to beat the shit out of you when we get home! You wait and see!” Robyn F. picked her cellular telephone and called her personal assistant, Jennifer Rosales at [redacted]. Rosales did not answer the telephone but while her voicemail greeting was playing, Robyn F. pretended to talk to her and stated, “I’m on my way home. Make sure the cops are there when I get there.” (This statement was made while the greeting was playing and was not captured as a message). After Robyn F. faked the call, Brown and looked at her and stated, “You just did the stupidest thing ever! Now I’m really going to kill you.” Brown resumed punching Robyn F. and she interlocked her fingers behind her head and brought her elbows forward to protect her face. She then bent over at the waist, placing her elbows and face near her lap in attempt to protect her face and head from the barrage of punches being levied upon her by Brown. Brown continued to punch Robyn F. on her left arm and hand causing her to suffer a contusion on her left triceps that was approximately two inches in diameter and numerous contusions on her left hand. Robyn F. then attempted to send a text message to her other personal assistant, Melissa Ford. Brown snatched the cellular telephone out of her hand and threw it out of the window onto an unknown street.

Brown continued driving and Robyn F. observed his cellular phone sitting in his lap. She picked up the cellular telephone with her left hand and before she could make a call he placed her in a head lock with his right hand and continued to drive the vehicle with his left hand. Brown pulled Robyn F. close to him and bit her on her left ear. She was able to feel the vehicle swerving from right to left as Brown sped away. He stopped the vehicle in front of [redacted] and Robyn F. turned off the car, removed the key from the ignition and sat on it. Brown did not know what she did with the key and began punching her in the face and arms. He then placed her in a head lock positioning the front of her throat between his bicep and forearm. Brown began applying pressure to Robyn F’s. left and right carotid arteries causing her to be unable to breathe and she began to lose consciousness. She reached up with her left hand and began attempting to gauge his eyes in an attempt to free herself. Brown bit her left ring and middle fingers and then released her. While Brown continued to punch her, she turned around and placed her back against the passenger door. She brought her knees to her chest, placed her feet against Brown’s body and began pushing him away. Brown continued to punch her on the legs and feet causing several contusions. Robyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighborhood heard Robyn F.’s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F. was issued a Domestic Violence Emergency Protective Order (EPO).",,,1619303809,{},gvralb4,False,t3_mxnf10,False,False,t1_gvrafcu,/r/AskReddit/comments/mxnf10/what_is_the_most_overrated_product_youve_purchased/gvralb4/,1619320245,8,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

In my opinion,, there’s many toxic things a parent can say to a child. It’s down to how the child handles it and their mental health. &lt;33",,,1619303802,{},gvraksn,False,t3_mxf4dl,False,True,t3_mxf4dl,/r/AskReddit/comments/mxf4dl/what_is_the_most_toxic_thing_a_parent_can_say_to/gvraksn/,1619320237,1,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

 The only redeeming feature the watch had was that I could use Spotify offline on the watch  and save playlists to it which meant I didn't have to take my phone with me when exercising but recently they took away that feature so now I completely regret my purchase and wish I could get my money back.

I just use it in an embedded home server to redirect http requests and P2P networking to an arbitrary country. Nord is the only provider that lets me use OpenVPN profiles over UDP and doesn't necessitate getting a new .ovpn profile every week because they decided to scramble something. Every other provider I've tried either breaks my connection after around a week or requires using their own proprietary client, which I can't do on my custom Debian server. For sensitive information I use Mullvad but for my less security-minded processes, Nord works well.

Also, the security concerns for Nord have been overblown. Everyone cites the server compromise but it was an out of commission exit node that didn't have anything sensitive on it.

Like I said, it's good to be a smart consumer but at the end of the day nearly every VPN service is going to have some issues and sometimes ""good enough"" really is ""good enough.""",,,1619303782,{},gvrajfn,False,t3_mxnf10,False,False,t1_gvr8zdb,/r/AskReddit/comments/mxnf10/what_is_the_most_overrated_product_youve_purchased/gvrajfn/,1619320216,23,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

I met an attractive guy at a surprisingly uneventful party in New York at the end of last year.  I was drunk, horny and very eager to get fucked hard so I gladly agreed when he asked me to come home with him. 

When we arrived at his place and started messing around, he told me he was into dominant women and being humiliated and that he thought I would make a great dom. Even though I'm not at all into submissive men (quite the contrary), I was feeling generous and wanted to make the most of the evening. He was so excited too, that I simply didn't have the heart to tell him no, so I stayed over and bossed him around a bit, made him worship my stilettos, slapped him repeatedly, called him humiliating names and jerked him off a bit. He was suuuper into it, but I was honestly bored out of my mind by the end and I kept waiting for him to cum. When he did, I asked him to call me an Uber and I proceeded to leave.

As I was on my way out, I noticed his flatmates had a guest over, who was a shady dealer and there was some sort of lame, lowkey party going on. They asked me to stay and do ""cocaine"" with them for free, which, lets be honest, I was never going to turn down. Straight away I noticed that it wasn't cocaine, but proceeded to take it anyway. Not long after, I started having a really bad trip and went into full panic mode when the dealer told us that it was fucking KETAMINE and not actual cocaine. One of his flatmates puked all over himself and was knocked out in the bathtub from the drugs and alcohol while the other one was freaking out and hyperventilating in the corner since his trip was even worse than mine and fell into a really bad k-hole. All the while, the dealer was hitting on me and continuously trying to touch me inappropriately, putting his hands up my skirt while I was floating between consciousness and could barely move. The whole night just spiraled into a complete nightmare. He had undone my bra by the time I regained consciousness.

Eventually I sobered up enough to storm off as quickly as I could while still high as fuck at 4:30am and realized my battery had died and I had no money so I had to walk an hour and a half back to my place in freezing temperatures. I somehow made it home alive thankfully.",,,1619303727,{},gvrafoo,False,t3_mxumih,False,True,t3_mxumih,/r/AskReddit/comments/mxumih/whats_the_creepiest_thing_a_person_has_ever_said/gvrafoo/,1619320158,3,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0,[],,

No, you don't. That was never the point of cable, outside of channels like HBO.

Originally, there were only a few channels that one had access to, all of them over-the-air. Say, NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX, PBS, and maybe one or two more, if you're lucky. Then when cable came about, people went, ""Wow, by paying a subscription, I can get access to a hundred more channels!"". These channels still had ads.

With the rise of streaming services (which do not typically have ads if you're paying for them), ordinary cable TV seems out of place, and is receding in popularity as a result.
