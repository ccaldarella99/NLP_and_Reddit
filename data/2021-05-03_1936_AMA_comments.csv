[],,ThatsWhatXiSaid,,,[],,,,text,t2_tykf1qc,False,True,[],"&gt; Yes the target was set for 2% but the figures over the year show that majority of the countries have failed to make an effort to reach the target.

NATO countries have increased from 1.47% of GDP in 2013 to 1.78% in 2020 on average. Assuming the trend continues that will put them at 1.96% by the 2024 goal. 

Just to put this in perspective (excluding US spending) the global average on defense is 1.81%. With $307.5 billion in spending, they dwarf China ($261.0 billion) and Russia ($65.1 billion). Combined with nuclear weapons, it's hard to imagine NATO being attacked even without US involvement.

&gt;Americans can’t benefit from their own taxpayers dollars because their country is spending that money to protect other countries.

Again, as I've shown the US is plenty wealthy enough to cover both military spending--which we should note the US spends more because we believe it benefits **us**--and other social programs. It should also be noted that even if the US were to decrease military spending to global averages it would barely cover 10% of our healthcare spending per year. It should also be noted that the US is already spending more taxpayer dollars per person on healthcare--our current system is just so amazingly inefficient the money doesn't go very far.",,,1620053658,{},gwsf5xi,False,t3_n3p5au,False,False,t1_gwr9lfw,/r/AMA/comments/n3p5au/i_am_from_denmark_a_country_where_we_pay_high/gwsf5xi/,1620083904,1,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],

---------|----------|----------|
You can *smell* horny people?|That's correct, and depending on the person it can be a very arousing and intoxicating scent, or nothing at all. This would have been nice if I couldn't smell it on myself aswell...|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwr5609/)
Please let us know what your doctor says when you see him soon! I hope things will get better for you|I'll keep y'all posted, though I fear there's not too much that can be done|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwr9ny9/)
How does this affect you as a member of society?|Honestly it affects me a lot, as all my functions one way or another is fueled by this. Socializing, doing errands, going out at all really, somehow, subconsciously I'm tricked into thinking that sex is a potential reward for literally all my actions.  Combined with a hypersensitive nose, I can smell hormones; As in, I can smell when people are horny, haven't gotten laid in a while, heck I've told my best friends (a couple) when hanging out at my place ""You're free to use my bedroom, I don't care"" minutes before they realize themselves they're moody. This one is a bit double sided because it has guided me a couple times, but most of the time it's just annoying and directly intoxicating and makes me go nuts.  Though I have a couple friends who understand my issues, it's VERY hard for me to create and maintain bonds with people because of this, because at one point or another I start to sexualize them.  Long story short, I spend 95% of my time locked up in my apartment living on welfare, because I can get so aggressively horny I can virtually feel myself crawl out of my own skin (satyroMANIA), it terrifies me so I reduce human contact as much as possible, so I'd say I'm not even a member of society at this point.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwqv4hq/)
Has this affected your willingness to have sex? Like do you try to limit yourself from indulging for any reason? Or do you just use tinder or find someone some other way?  Also has this affected your sexuality/gender preferende at all?|\&gt; Has this affected your willingness to have sex? Like do you try to limit yourself from indulging for any reason? Or do you just use tinder or find someone some other way? Oh man if it were up to me I'd be having sex 24/7, but I'm banned from Tinder for having a shirtless photo on my profile (I'm a guy) and well I'm autistic as shit, no one wants me.  \&gt; Also has this affected your sexuality/gender preferende at all? Actually yeah it has, as a young teenager I was completely straight, and were only interested in girls my age. Now I'm a open-minded pansexual, I'm into everyone and everything, as long it can give consent it's good enough for me.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwra9m2/)
So does this mean you are too horny to function?   Do you think gunpowder is angry sand?  Can you control your horniness if you want?|\&gt; So does this mean you are too horny to function? At times, I get so horny that I fear myself and what I can accomplish, sometimes it literally affects my entire body to the point where I'm just worming and wiggling around wanting it to stop.  \&gt; Do you think gunpowder is angry sand? No, it's sand but with a short fuse.  \&gt; Can you control your horniness if you want? As in ""channeling it into something creative""? Fuck no. I smoke a crapload of weed though and that helps a little bit|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwr4s7i/)
At first i thought "" damn this dude has got the cheat codes, should be happy"" but after reading more, it seems like a curse .  In a perfect world you could just wander around  seeking out the horny people and fuck them all, but the reality is a lot different|Yeah man, the word ""Curse"" is exactly the word I'd use, this is pain.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwrgf99/)
Are you male or female?|Satyromania is the male version of Nymphomania, so yeah I'm a guy|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwr23sm/)
Do you have issue forming proper romantic relationships?|I don't do romance, for a lot of different reasons, though this is one of them|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwr4j02/)
Have you ever had sex with a nymphomaniac? I'm just imagining two people just constantly banging to either assert dominance or to see which one will quit first.|Hehe, back when my ex and I lived together, it was basically non-stop fucking all the time with the exception of the times when I wrecked her so badly she needed days to recover. Then there were days when I was knocked out, that motherfucker spiked my milkshake with viagra. Guys think they want a lot of sex until they meet a woman who wants a lot of sex.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwrnaj3/)
What’s the worst instance where your disorder affected your life?|The fact that I barely have any interests aside from sex, nothing else in live matters or motivates me. I'm starting to lose interest in all my other hobbies, like gaming, programing, editing, socializing, it's plain depressing to be honest.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwr5mkn/)

How do you cope with it?|I jerk off, a lot, I smoke a crapload of weed, and I jerk off some more|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwrnlli/)
Pornhub or xvideos|I've prolly watched out all them sites bro|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/n3nlgv/im_a_diagnosed_satyromaniac_ama/gwromc3/)
