Not a question I just needed to say congratulations that‚Äôs amazing|Thank you!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu4biw/i_am_a_recovering_13_year_heroinopiate_addict_who/gv3iky9/)
Have you ever tried Ibogaine? It's a drug that eliminates all sorts of addiction to things like meth, heroin, cocaine, etc. Although it's only legal in Mexico, there are a bunch of Ibogaine treatment facilities there for addicts that are struggling a fuck ton, and it really works!|I haven‚Äôt tried ibogaine, although I‚Äôve had friends who tried and stayed clean for a long time. I don‚Äôt think I needed the torture associated with ibogaine, I just needed something to make me acutely aware of my inner dialogue with myself.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu4biw/i_am_a_recovering_13_year_heroinopiate_addict_who/gv3j2dt/)
Congratulations on staying off the shit.  Was the psychedelic use intended to bring about sobriety?  And how have you maintained your sobriety?|I used lsd. I have maintained my sobriety from learning to work with my own mind. It‚Äôs been a long road of studying and evolving. I am not even the same person I was 6 years ago. In my experience not understanding how to work with your own mind is the main problem with addicts. Essentially an addict has built a prison for themselves without understanding they are the warden; they look for answers everywhere but it‚Äôs inside them. Unfortunately that‚Äôs the last place anyone wants to look.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu4biw/i_am_a_recovering_13_year_heroinopiate_addict_who/gv3jco1/)
When is the best time to yell ""this is sparta!!!!""|You‚Äôll know it when the time is right.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu4biw/i_am_a_recovering_13_year_heroinopiate_addict_who/gv3knzp/)
After the initial withdrawal I‚Äôm assuming you were constantly tired and unmotivated. How long did this last for, does it ever go away?|The worst part lasted for a week or so, and then I was sluggish and cloudy for months. It will go away, but I think someone needs to sit with it and really go into what is happening mentally. There were times I‚Äôd sit for hours just observing my negative thoughts come in waves, just observing and reminding myself thoughts aren‚Äôt real.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu4biw/i_am_a_recovering_13_year_heroinopiate_addict_who/gv3mkm9/)
Did you ever fall sleep sitting up with a lit cigarette in your hand and wake up to see just a stick of ash between your fingers?|I have fell asleep and the cigarette had burned all the way into my fingertips and blistered without waking up. I am responsible for a LOT of cigarette burns in beds and blankets.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu4biw/i_am_a_recovering_13_year_heroinopiate_addict_who/gv3rmnt/)
That's great!|Thank you!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu4biw/i_am_a_recovering_13_year_heroinopiate_addict_who/gv3xtjv/)
Do you credit the trip to your recovery? What psychedelic did you use? What was the revelation that changed your mind set? Do you trip regularly now in order to keep up this reminder of sorts?|I directly accredit the trip for my recovery. I used lsd. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend just anyone to do this, but it just so happened to work for me. The experience I had was a strange one. My mind kept splitting into more and more personalities, until I was listening to a whole village of different people have a conversation in my head. It just kept building and building in intensity until finally I was at a breaking point. All of a sudden my mind gave in to a profound realization that all these voices were my inner dialogue that I lived with daily without noticing. I had become a slave to unnoticed negative thoughts playing on repeat in the back of my mind. Once I started noticing them I realized that‚Äôs exactly why I was using the whole time, to silence them. That night I realized how to notice thought loops and understand I don‚Äôt have to identify with them.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu4biw/i_am_a_recovering_13_year_heroinopiate_addict_who/gv3jbw5/)
how hard is it to stay clean?|It wasn‚Äôt easy but it gets better with time. I took the nuclear option and cut out everyone in my life that may lead me back to it. If you give in to your thoughts easily, it‚Äôs damn near impossible. It took a psychedelic to rewire my brain to be able to do it after many failed attempts.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu4biw/i_am_a_recovering_13_year_heroinopiate_addict_who/gv3own7/)
Are whippets as dangerous as heroin?|I don‚Äôt know, I wouldn‚Äôt want to give bad advice but I can say heroin is just about the most dangerous thing to play with that I can think of. I would recommend any drugs tbh. Just because something worked for me doesn‚Äôt mean it would work for anyone else.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu4biw/i_am_a_recovering_13_year_heroinopiate_addict_who/gv3t0mw/)
So, youre 19 now, or you quit heroin when you were seven?|I was a 13 year addict, not 13 year old addict|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu4biw/i_am_a_recovering_13_year_heroinopiate_addict_who/gv3zt69/)

In the first outcome, there is sin, death, and the prolonging of a life. In the second there is no sin and two deaths. Therefore the most moral outcome is the second.

This situation, however, is unfair. When the choice is made on whether or not to abort, there is no knowledge on the outcome, so the situation would better be posed as ‚ÄúWhat about a situation where the child dies and the mother doesn‚Äôt or the child has a 0.625% chance of being stillborn and the mother has a 0.0264% chance in dying during childbirth, assuming she lives in the US.‚Äù Not only does the choice become easier to see, it also puts the situation into perspective. Yes, there will be situation when both do die, but they are rather unlikely, at a 0.0165% chance. I‚Äôm not saying that it is acceptable for both to die, I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs unacceptable for anyone to die, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we play executioner. If we want situations like that to stop happening, we improve our medical knowledge so that both stillbirth and child birth death are unheard of, not permit the death of one for the safety of another. No life is greater than another‚Äôs.

I am very sorry that the woman that you knew is dead. It is terrible that such a thing could happen. In a book I read recently, The Kite Runner, a man is recounting his final meeting with the mother of the protagonist, who died giving birth to him:

In other words, the hypothesis attempts to account for why siblings don't become sexually attracted to each other.

This hypothesis would go a long way toward explaining why your half sister and you developed an attraction toward each other despite being closely biologically related. Since you weren't actually reared together, you simply didn't have a chance to develop the ""normal"" sexual avoidance of each other.

Note that I'm not making a value judgement about your relationship.

This AMA is an opportunity for readers to interact with and examine the strong cultural gut-reaction of taboo. 

For those who aren‚Äôt blinded by an initial emotional reaction, there is much insight to be gained about our cultural identity by contemplating how a ‚Äúdeviant‚Äù may actually be dignified or intelligent. If a ‚Äúdeviant‚Äù is well-spoken, even-keeled, respectful and communicates a concern for other's well being, do they deserve to be shunned? Or is it the more that creates the reaction unconsciously? 

Many people have said it but it deserves to be asked again‚Äî if no one is being harmed, what exactly is the problem? Given the wide range of ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù violence and abuse in American society, the puritanical reaction to sexuality is always stark.

[],,rihon31042,,,[],,,,text,t2_bju1fjtq,False,False,[],"I think I've a bit of a problem with ""preach the gospel in a less harmful way"".   


I should add that I was born and raised Catholic and never personally experienced Christianity in a harmful way. Quite the contrary, for a very long time I thought it's prime teachings to be very appealing and just the definition of 'good'. However, growing older, I did see the wrongs of the church, and as you, I attributed it to 'human failure' and it didn't really impact on my believes. I also accepted that other faiths and teaching have similar human ground-truths, and for myself I made peace by personally believing into a one-god-many-aspects-many-religions kind of thing.  The fact that *the majority* of pious people acted in a way I couldn't agree with, did bother me only at the periphery of the mind, although it was somewhat strange that 'the best Christians' should be those which are least tied to the church and its dogmatic teachings...  


I had similar issues with all the mystical aspects of the religion (wonders etc.) and how they clashed with objective truth and scientific, fact based reasoning. I kind of internalized this by telling myself that those fairy-tale stories were just illustrations to teach people the truth, and that naturally stories create for people of hundredths of years ago had to be different to 'work' than they would need to be now. Hence I never understood those who build their faith literally on the bible. (Or by extension to other holy texts in other faiths.)  


But where did this journey lead me? If I do \*not\* believe in most of the dogma presented by the Catholic church, and did \*not\* agree with a large extend of what its leaders did and preached, and did look with disgust on how very large groups of so-called Christians acted because of their faith... Why did or could I call myself Catholic still? So, without changing my denomination I more and more considered myself a Christian without church (while out of habit and cultural reasons still remaining Catholic.). But putting the dogma/teachings further back and back what remained? My strong belief in what I consider morally right and 'good' and a clear view on what I think the positive aspects of churches and religious groups are. However, I more and more realized: Where is god in this? Or rather, where is the *need* of a god in this? Given, that nobody has a proof of a god, that the 'good things' of religions could be achieved by humans just based on reason and humanity, but that a huge amount of really 'bad things' happen *because* of religion; why should one believe in a god? Or rather - why should one adjust ones life to the needs of a hypothetical being and even more so the *interpretation* of the will of a hypothetical being by humans with failures and other less pure motifs? And thus I became an atheist.   


I honestly don't think anymore that religions bring anything to the table that is positive. Yes, good things happen 'in the name of god' - but why shouldn't it be possible to have them happen regardless of a god? Do I need a higher being that judges me to do good? I don't think so. Does it mean that I deny the possibility of a higher being? No. But unless I get a reason to believe in one as a *fact* not as an *imaginary concept, however fitting it is* I will act as if it doesn't exist and I will definitely deny anybody trying to influence my life based on nothing but referring to fictional stories. Example: You think adultery is wrong? Maybe so, but if you want to convince me of it being morally wrong, then you have to do better than ""Because god says so"". (For reference, adultery is definitely wrong in my personal moral frame. I would feel wrong doing it, and I would feel wronged if loved ones would do it. But it is wrong for me because I made a personal vow to somebody, and I know that person's opinion and feeling about it. So I know I would hurt and destroy trust.)    


And this brings me back to ""preach the gospel in a less harmful way"". To me, the only way this can be achieved is by preaching without any reference to any supernatural or higher being. Without reference to any dogma or holy book that is seen as literal truth. The moment I postulate *anything* as the unchangeable truth which cannot be doubted or disagreed with, I open the door to the having it abused in the most horrific way. But what remains of religion (any), if I take that away?",,,1618857861,{},gv42kfq,False,t3_mtlmc9,False,True,t1_gv3fnff,/r/AMA/comments/mtlmc9/im_a_catholic_who_used_to_be_atheist_ama/gv42kfq/,1618864253,1,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],,

(I was around 5 or 6 when this happened) She had two pigtails and every time I'd see her they were died a different color, up until the tie holding it together. The actual hair streaming out of the pig-tails was still the natural brown every time. She had a white dress that didn't attach to her hips at all, so basically like a horror movie doll. One day, she started talking about death, and I really didn't want to talk about it but I couldn't shut her voice out of my head. She started talking about methods of how one could kill themselves, and I really REALLY didn't want to think about it, so I finally started screaming and banging my head on the wall. I must have passed out, because the next thing I remember is being in a hospital bed. They couldn't figure out why I did it, and I had shown no evidence of suicidal thoughts before, so they just sent me home with some aspirin or something for the headache. But after that, when I tried to talk to her again, I couldn't. (Yes, I can ""wish"" them to talk to me, but most of the time they just pop up out of nowhere) I kept calling out to her for the next few days, but nothing, and then finally she appeared maybe a week after the ""incident"" and she had a rope around her neck. (Quite possibly the strangest thing, I didn't even know what a noose was, let alone that it was a way to kill yourself.) She started screaming less than a second after she appeared, and it got so loud that I squeezed my eyes shut and put my hands over my ears, and when she finally stopped and I opened my eyes, she wasn't there anymore. To this day if I try to bring her up or make her appear, she doesn't come. 

My strangest person... that is an interesting one. His name is TJ (quite possibly because my favorite player in the NFL is named TJ Watt) and he's around my age. He's basically my version of two-face from DC. He has a robotic left arm that is shinny black with specks of gold. He has a make-shift eyepatch on his left eye too. His skin on his entire left side is kind of old and saggy, like he's been in a fire, but whenever I ask him about it, he just says ""adventures"" and changes the subject. Once, he took of his shoes, and the toes weren't there, it was just a stub of a foot.

---------|----------|----------|
Love it! What did you do before you got into the crypto space?|I'm operating punk4156 anonymously, so you'll have to excuse me if I don't get too specific here. I've spent the last 15 years engaged in different combinations of creative, tech, finance, and entrepreneurial ventures. I discovered Bitcoin in 2013 when a friend at one of those ventures mentioned that he 'thought it was too late for mining'. I said 'mining what?' and went home and started reading everything I could about Bitcoin. The rest was history.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv3614q/)
How does it feel?|I broke down and cried when I won the auction, that's how historically important this piece...oh, you want *that* answer...feels good man.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv363fa/)
Do you prefer to collect from established artists or try and bring smaller artists into the spotlight?|There's definitely a place for both. Non-fungible tokens will capture so many different kinds of value. I think we're currently seeing an interesting mix of a) people growing new brands around the new medium, and b) people importing existing brands into the new medium. IMO it's difficult to prefer one over the other without excluding yourself from a large set of opportunities. Eventually it will make sense to specialize, but it's so early.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv368gs/)
How did you get your start in crypto? I've followed you on Twitter for a month or so now and you've seemingly gained some notoriety pretty quickly, so I'm just curious about how you got started with it all.|See the answer above. Tl;dr worked in art, finance, and tech in various capacities, friend mentioned something called Bitcoin in 2013 and I fell down the rabbit hole.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv369hb/)
I love the 420 being there.|The other bidder had 380 ETH in their wallet, and I realized they were going to use it all. Once I got to 400, I had to do it. I didn't hesitate for a moment.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv35x76/)
I have seen you collect X-COPY Artworks. I am trying to grab the story behind it. Can you explain what pulls you towards XCOPYART ?|In my experience, most things that are worth doing with a lot of conviction, are worth doing for many different reasons at once. I think this is very true wrt collecting XCOPY's work. The work is simultaneously aesthetically amazing, and conceptually interesting, very historically important, authentic, native to the medium (as Pak said, 'you can't print out an XCOPY'), and also documenting crypto history. In some sense XCOPY \*is\* crypto art. I think he will be one of the most important artists of the movement, and the movement will be one of the most important cultural phenomena in the world. Which practically makes XCOPY the most important artist in the world. Nobody really sees this yet, but I think they will soon.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv36351/)
What do you look for when buying nft artwork on the secondary market?  ( Also love seeing your tweets - always interesting :D )|Is it conceptually interesting? Is it aesthetically pleasing? Is it historically important? Is the work native to the medium? Is it authentic? Is it in the top 1% of work? Is the artist a reasonable person? Are they likely to stick around long-term? Do they have what it takes to become world famous? Will other people want this? Am I the first to discover this? These are the kinds of questions I'm trying to ask myself. There's no perfect formula, but most pieces should satisfy most of these requirements before buying.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv36bhx/)
Thanks in advance for this AMA! Do you think Investing in NFT brings more returns than crypto? Would love to hear your comprehensive look on it!|There are almost definitely pieces that will outperform ETH, so I think a better question to ask is 'do you think investing in a portfolio of NFTs provides a better risk / reward than investing in ETH'. I think this is a really tough question to answer, and I think about it an awful lot. My best answer is probably 'not on average, but it depends on the portfolio...'. IMO it's nearly a certainty that ETH goes 10-50x in the next decade (not investment advice, don't invest more than you're willing to lose...). There are NFT pieces that will go 1000x in the same period, but can you find them? Are you willing to commit as much capital to them as you would to ETH itself? The main reason to be bullish on NFTs is probably the reason I'm doing what I'm doing, and Metakovan is doing what he's doing. At some point many of us in crypto will have more capital than we need in the real world, and investing it in digital cultural artifacts is a lot of fun.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv36blt/)
What makes **Genesis Pepe** worth that much?  What is your favorite cryptocurrency?  Why?|I'm very partial to Ethereum. I think Vitalik is a once-in-a-generation genius and that the community that has gathered around his project (now the internet's project) reflects his own kindness, intelligence, and long-term thinking.  The short answer for the Pepe, is that copies make originals more valuable (this is one of the reasons I love and foster 4156 as a meme), and that Pepe is the most copied and memed object in internet history. The Pepe genesis is, in the long run, not only worth 'that much', but worth 100s of times more. Nobody realizes this yet, but it is likely a priceless cultural artifact. Our generation's Mona Lisa.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv380m9/)
Being that your online personality revolves around punk4156, do you think you would ever sell it  if someone offers you a considerable sum of ETH?|While it's difficult to imagine doing that now, in my business life I typically get bored of things after 4 or 5 years, and move on to the next frontier. I'm not sure if that will happen this time, but if it does, it should coincide nicely with the NFT ecosystem maturing, and 4156 becoming something that could be owned by the entire community. So if I do eventually sell her, it could be to a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) or other form of community ownership.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv38kgy/)
This was a brilliant investment probably the most influential drawing in human cultural history.|This is making me cry again. I get nauseous even thinking about the responsibility of owning it. I will never understand, but always be grateful for this opportunity.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv39fll/)
Why did that cost 1 million?|The real question, with nothing but respect for Matt, is why didn't it cost 100 million? So help me I will make sure he realizes some of that value in my lifetime.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv3c7gc/)
What is ""ETH""|[https://ethereum.org/](https://ethereum.org/en/)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv3d8z3/)
Do u have plan to help artist or just the famous|I have spent a very large percentage of my net worth on up-and-coming artists. Do u have a plan?|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mu28gq/i_bought_matt_furies_genesis_pepe_for_420eth/gv3gpzi/)

Some lesbians would come in to sell weed. Man they had some killer shit. Some times they would hang out and we would goof on each other.

This one group was always checking to make sure we were not selling butts to minors. They nailed me once. A little while later they got caught big time and couldn‚Äôt sell smokes for a week. 

Some little dude came in and wanted rolling papers. I said little dude I don‚Äôt care but we get tested all the time and I cant sell to you. 

Although I wasn‚Äôt there, someone went into the bathroom and shot up and OD. Now you had to ask for the keys to the bathroom and they noticed they had been gone for 30 minutes. They opened the door and they were on the floor with needle still in their arm. There was blood everywhere and now the bathroom was considered toxic site. 

Another time with a different person at the register this gal came in and said she has to use the bathroom really bad. She had track marks on both arms. The gal behind the counter said you got 10 minutes in the bathroom and then I will come in. Don‚Äôt know what happened next.

Question | Answer | Link
---------|----------|----------|
Can you make sounds like: k,sh,t,p,f ? Because these dont use vocal cords, its just air coming out and the tongue moving right?|Yes! I can make those sounds, I typically use ‚Äútsch‚Äù to get people‚Äôs attention when I want to interact with them|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2gmnq/)
can you make like whispery sounds|No, I have complete vocal cord paralysis, meaning I can‚Äôt make vocal sounds. But I do understand your thought process!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2e5em/)
How'd your parents figure out about it?  I imagine in some scenarios folks would get worried simply because the child couldn't speak.|Well the doctors thought I was dead when I was born so that should clear it up lol|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2dkun/)
What are some signs that everyone should know that would help mute people out in day-to-day life?|Definitely what u/The_Greate_Pickle commented, if the ASL alphabet was part of standardized learning, it would help more than just mute people|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2e8az/)
Have you found any silver linings related to your condition? For example, many abled people feel rushed or pressured into communicating without thinking when they need to talk, but someone unable to may have the opportunity to think before they speak, thus feeling less pressure as a result of their condition. Do you find that to be true for you, and are there other such (seeming) advantages you've discovered?|I feel that‚Äôs true yes, though my condition doesn‚Äôt really make me feel excluded or depressed about life, other things do that lol|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2g3wi/)
Wait what happends when ur laughting  like do u make the sound or not ?|I do make a sound, though it‚Äôs mostly just breathy airy nothingness lol|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2rqxt/)
Do you have an inner voice? How does it sound like?  Is there any operation that can make you be able to speak? Have you thought about doing the operation?|Yes I have an inner voice, and it‚Äôs my moms, because it‚Äôs the most comforting and familiar. But there‚Äôs always a surgery for anything, though my condition would require a very expensive and highly experimental/potentially fatal, so I think I‚Äôll stick with being mute for now lol|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2w8av/)
I can't imagine bawling my eyes out without making a sound. What's it like for you to cry/sob?|Mostly just sniffling and tearing up|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2nv9r/)
What's the best part about being mute?|I don‚Äôt have to make phone calls|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2omyq/)
I came from the other post, what is the primary way you speak to people, do you use sign with your parents? What other methods of communication do you use from day to day?|Mainly I keep to myself as I don‚Äôt really leave my house unless it‚Äôs for work, I prefer to communicate with people with ASL, but if they don‚Äôt know it, I just use my phone to type what I want to say.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2a9lh/)
Born mute? What does it mean?|I was born with vocal cord paralysis, meaning I can‚Äôt speak|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv29tkr/)
Are you able to make noise at all, or is it completely inability to make noise|Noises like whistling I can still do, just not like humming or anything to do with a ‚Äúvoice‚Äù|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2cm1m/)
How have you overcome the stereotypical means of forming relationships such as family, friendships, workplace and SO's without vocal communication?|Using my phone to communicate with those who don‚Äôt know ASL|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2cub5/)
How are you finding the string of ""silence is violence"" memes?|Honestly I‚Äôm fairly certain I started tjem lol|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2m5bw/)
Hey! First of all thank you for doing this!   I hope this isn't really a bad question, but I'm asking because this is something I'm thinking of lately! So I hope it makes sense!  If one of your friends learned sign language so they could communicate with you without using phones or paper and so on, would you think of it as a nice gesture, or would you find it a bit odd?  And one more thing! Do you think it's easier for you to communicate with people because of technology today rather than if you were to need to keep a pen and paper on you? I feel like it helps, but I'm not sure why other than that it saves time, so are there other ways it facilitates things for you?  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks a lot in advance! Have a lovely day!|It isn‚Äôt odd to learn a new language to speak with others is it? Same is applied to ASL! And yeah having a phone is so much easier than pen and paper|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2mbrl/)
Is there some kind of surgery you could undergo to improve the vocal situation? If there was, would you even want to do it?|I‚Äôm sure there is but I‚Äôm also certain it‚Äôs highly experimental and dangerous, not to mention the expense..

Does it bother you being mute? You seem to talk about it quite easily, it it just something you're used to now and can live with, or do you feel like it sucks?|Well you can‚Äôt really miss/mourn for something you‚Äôve never had, so it‚Äôs just life for me :3|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv2q0zp/)
What does it feel like?|Well that‚Äôs a broad question, lol, I suppose it feels like anything else would|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtwrq7/i_19f_was_born_mute_ama/gv337cs/)

Amusingly enough, some Christian denominations would say he'd still be going to Heaven, as long as he was saved and baptized before he started his crime spree (Bible Baptists, I'm looking at you here!). I personally don't think that, but that's more because the theoretical murderer caused harm to people (him/her self and others), which is my personal definition of ""sin"".

OP, on the other hand, isn't harming anyone through his actions or beliefs. The beliefs given to him by other people as he was growing up (which is the literal definition of [indoctrination](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/indoctrination), by the way, but because it's *our* society doing it to *our* children, it's fine. Other societies teaching *their* values to *their* children are wrong, though, unless of course they have the same values and beliefs that we do. How does that even make sense?) are causing him mental anguish. So who's being sinned against here?

&gt; But like I said, take religion out of it, incest is still not okay.

What's your definition of ""incest""? What causes it to be ""wrong""? As I said in my other response to you, to me the only thing wrong about incest is when there's a distinct possibility of genetic reinforcement of a bad gene, causing mental or physical defects in any children. Since OP is practicing safe sex, then that doesn't come into play, so there's nothing wrong about their relationship.

Before you point out that it's ""immoral"", let me mention that morals are simply a set of guidelines that a society has agreed upon to attempt to show people how they should behave toward one another, there's nothing ""natural"" about them. They're a learned set of behaviors, nothing more. They *are* important, don't misunderstand me, because they teach us how we **should** behave toward one another. But they also shouldn't be used to control people. That's what laws are for, and I've already pointed out the issue I have with most ""incest"" laws in the United States.",,,1618845899,{},gv3a27p,False,t3_mtsq4s,False,True,t1_gv2xmhq,/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv3a27p/,1618847619,1,True,False,AMA,t5_2r4eo,,0,[],,

There are multiple definitions of atheism. Most atheists define it as ""lack of belief in a god"" (this is the minimum requirement to be an atheist), some goes a step further and say ""I believe there is no god"" and then even fewer says ""There are no god(s)"".

Alot of theists like to define it as: ""There definately are no gods!"", because that is an easier definition to argue against, making them seem less irrational in contrast.

I am an agnostic atheist, and I don't know whether or not there is a god, but i believe there are no gods.

---------|----------|----------|
For me, it was a soda with caffeine. End result, is the same.  Does this happen to you often that you‚Äôre up all night?|No never. It‚Äôs only happened one other time and that was when I accidentally took a pain medication with caffeine in it before bed|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtv676/decided_it_would_be_a_good_idea_to_drink_coffee/gv21fft/)
Im envious that coffee works for you even though it looks like you're screwed|Here‚Äôs the thing. Coffee doesn‚Äôt work for me during the day. It doesn‚Äôt give me energy at all. So I wrongly assumed it would be the same thing at night.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtv676/decided_it_would_be_a_good_idea_to_drink_coffee/gv231r3/)
Watching your phone screen will definitely *not* help. It's as powerful a sleep prevention as all the coffee...|Dad is that you? Lol I‚Äôm kidding I know I should get off but I just can‚Äôt sleep and I don‚Äôt like to be alone with my thoughts for too long|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtv676/decided_it_would_be_a_good_idea_to_drink_coffee/gv27w4e/)
Bet you won‚Äôt do that again, right? I feel your pain. My wife suggested drinking tea before bed. It didn‚Äôt dawn on me initially why I was having trouble falling asleep until I realized that the caffeine in the tea was keeping me up. No more tea for me before bed!|You are absolutely right I will never do that again. Also yeah some teas have caffeine in them but some actually don‚Äôt and there are some that are made especially for sleep so maybe try those!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtv676/decided_it_would_be_a_good_idea_to_drink_coffee/gv2fxch/)
Did you fall asleep yet?|Lol I was finally able to go to sleep at around 3 am|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtv676/decided_it_would_be_a_good_idea_to_drink_coffee/gv2n1gc/)
I have insomnia and cannot get to sleep anyway, I'll stay up too. How did the night go?|Not too bad! I finally went to sleep around three am which means I got around 5 hours of sleep. Not too bad but not ideal I guess|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtv676/decided_it_would_be_a_good_idea_to_drink_coffee/gv2t7rp/)
Why would you drink coffee before bed lol?|1. It doesn‚Äôt give me extra energy if I drink it during the day so I foolishly assumed it wouldn‚Äôt do anything 2. I‚Äôm not the best decision make|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtv676/decided_it_would_be_a_good_idea_to_drink_coffee/gv24qzh/)
What kind of coffee? Single origin or blend? What's your favorite region?|Umm cold brew? With lots of milk and some creamer. I‚Äôm just starting to like coffee so I don‚Äôt drink too much of it. I think it‚Äôs Columbian though|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtv676/decided_it_would_be_a_good_idea_to_drink_coffee/gv24wq0/)

I hope this isn't really a bad question, but I'm asking because this is something I'm thinking of lately! So I hope it makes sense! 

If one of your friends learned sign language so they could communicate with you without using phones or paper and so on, would you think of it as a nice gesture, or would you find it a bit odd? 

And one more thing! Do you think it's easier for you to communicate with people because of technology today rather than if you were to need to keep a pen and paper on you? I feel like it helps, but I'm not sure why other than that it saves time, so are there other ways it facilitates things for you?

First of all, neurodivergence is worth taking into consideration. There are many people who feel like their neurodivergence in some way affects their gender, which is a big portion of people with xenogenders. This might seem like 'making their neurodivergence their whole identity', but a lot of people don't understand how being ND can often affect the entire way your brain works and how you view yourself. So it makes perfect sense to me how it could affect gender identity for an individual; I'm autistic and that definitely has *some* influence on it for me.

&gt;I feel like that's relating to an animal, and animals aren't genders.

The color pale lemon yellow and the letter e are inexplicably tied to my gender (might be my mild synesthesia, which is another example of how being ND could influence it tbh) so I don't find it utterly wild that someone could tie their gender with an animal.

You might get a better answer from someone who uses those sorts of pronouns but this is all I can offer ig

Which sounds so terrible but if you get emotionally involved in calls you'll get too fucked up to actually be helpful. I've given CPR more times than I can remember and it doesn't phase me at all. The calls that are most memorable are the ones that were hilarious, your first calls of a certain type, OR more likely the ones so terrible you can't forget them despite your best effort. I'll give you new examples of each.

First let's do a first. The first time I had to talk someone through delivering their own child was a big deal to me. They're rare calls because most people make it to the hospital before that point. But i took a call, wife having her second or third child. I ask the how far along and how far apart are contractions. Over 35weeks and 30 seconds apart. Baby is coming. Dad is busy holding the other kids so he puts me on speaker phone so I can talk to his sister-in-law/wife's sister who is getting ready to catch. We actually have scripts to assist us but I'd never used it other than in training. I remember feeling panic that I was going to make a mistake and trying to not laugh as I read the word vagina over and over as well as saying ""be careful not to drop the baby they are slippery"".  Baby was born healthy and I actually got to meet her years later. Apparently they knew a fireman who I work with and got a copy of the call. I was told they play it on her birthday every year. And they got me some nice thank you gifts.

A fucked up one. A 20 something kid took too much heroin and has overdosed. His mom calls for medics but by default we also send police because our officers are already mobile and carry Narcan. Officer arrives and she refuses to answer the door because she was also doing drugs and didn't want to get arrested. She's yelling at me for sending ""the fucking cops"" and I'm desperately trying to get her to understand the officer has narcan and it's what your son needs. She still refuses so officers break the door down and try to administer narcan, but it's too late. Her son died as she actively prevented him from getting help for several minutes so that she wouldn't get arrested.

And let's end on a happier note. This one I was dispatching I didn't take the call. It's a welfare check on a subject walking on the interstate. White female, long hair, topless. I put the call out and every available officer in that city marked enroute. First unit on scene keys up and advises it's actually going to be a heavyset shirtless male with long hair.

Uh, that's a very good one. Honestly, it seems so simple now, but learning about the differences between holistic and individualistic cultures made alot of the world make much better sense. 


For those who do not know holistic cultures are very group-oriented. The role an individual plays in a family, or a group is often a main priority and can superseed the individuals wants. 
Whereas the individualistic cultures are as we know them in the west, focused on the individual gain. 


There are of cause nuances all over the world, but those two templates made me understand the cultures clashes in my own country alot more and gave me a new perspective which I believe could be to the betterment of all if taught properly.

Question | Answer | Link
---------|----------|----------|
Do your parents know?|No, they haven't found out. Although there have been some close calls.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv1ny79/)
Do you use protection when you have sex?  Is she on BC?|I use protection when we get intimate, but she currently isn't on birth control so we don't do it very often. We both know how disastrous it could be if she got pregnant.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv1rtzs/)
Are you afraid of social stigmatization?|Very much so. It gave me depression for a while thinking of how people would view us.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv1o6d9/)
Is she the first girl you‚Äôve been with?  Has she been with anybody before?|I had a few girlfriends through high school but never really went past second base, the most intimate thing I had done before was with hands.  She had one boyfriend freshman year, but it was a typical early high school thing and didn't go past hugging and kissing.  So yes before it's asked, we took each other's virginity.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv1rxdy/)
How do you think you‚Äôre parents will react?|Our hope is they never find out, but we know it will most likely happen at some point, its unreasonable to assume that they could be oblivious forever.  If they found out now, I think I would probably be forcibly separated from her and kicked out, with college funding cut off.  If they find out when we are moved out and done with school, it would still suck as they'd cut all ties most likely, but they couldn't really do much at that point.  It's still scary to think of though as they are very religious and conservative, and I know they would disapprove.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv1s6jn/)
Do you love her?|Yes, with all my heart.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv1npga/)
Do you still believe in God?|Yes.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv1ox48/)
Do you live in the USA?|Yes.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv1srtw/)
Have you had anal sex?|We tried once, but she wasn't into it.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv1tq5j/)
Were you with other lovers before each other, you know like sexually?|I had a few girlfriends, but I was never intimate with them. She had one boyfriend when she was 15, but it was a typical high school thing and was short-lived.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv1ovbc/)
Do you have part time jobs? Are you saving a nest egg for worst-case scenarios?|This is gonna be my last answer for the night, will do more in the morning.  She's currently working as a cashier in a local fast food joint. I work part-time at a mechanic shop that my best-friends dad owns. We have been saving up a portion of each of our paychecks when possible for the past year or so. We have enough to get by if things went south.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/mtsq4s/i_22m_am_in_a_committed_relationship_with_my/gv1ulmq/)

Two of my best friend actually and it was so bizarre. Back in 2005-2006 that was like, whoa, taboo subject. And so I naturally freaked out on them and even almost felt like snitching them out. Then at this local event one of my friends had gotten into a car accident and had some Vicodin and he was just like so freaking happy and different it honestly threw me off more because he was just so happy to be talking with people when he is usually a quiet nerd like me. But he also started to believe 9/11 conspiracies and stuff around this time and it gave me this weird feeling that if I started taking drugs I would end up thinking stuff like that. But I love that guy, platonically, still and I know he got help but his story is not mine to tell or reveal.

A year after that I had my wisdom tooth operation and when I woke up from it I was all doped up from the operation. One of my parents told me on the way home, ‚ÄúWow you are being really nice to me! We gotta keep you on that stuff‚Äù (jokingly of course, referring to the drug). I‚Äôm certain I had untreated ADD growing up. 

But up until that point I never liked drugs and were frankly frightened of them. I actually didn‚Äôt try weed until I had basically tried most hard drugs. Opioids were the only one I got hooked on though, I think that‚Äôs worth nothing. Meth is just stupid for me, it‚Äôs a little too intense and it just makes me have to Pee and drink a lot of water. Adderall is great though and it calms me down so much. I can sleep on it sometimes in the morning, it‚Äôs crazy. 

But yeah I definitely think if I had been more careful after my wisdom tooth operation I could have avoided that, maybe. I think in some ways I was likely to experiment with drugs just because of other things in life, given how positively I responded to opiates at just 16.
